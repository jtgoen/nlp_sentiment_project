The prime rib came with no horseradish sauce or au jus. I asked for a horseradish sauce, which they had, but the container was so small I had to ask for another.

They immediately set up the table while about 4 of my friends and I waited; the hostess, after taking my name, never spoke to us again. She did not tell us when we could sit, how long it would be, or any other information. And then they made us wait for 75% of our party to show up before they would seat us. Mind you, there was no one else waiting, and the table was ready, and we were ready to order. But they didn't tell us this; I didn't even know why we were being forced to wait until I heard a supervisor whispering to the waitress about making us wait. I still have no idea why we were forced to wait. \n\nWhen my full party was finally seated, we were helped by two waiters who were perfectly polite and nice. BUT, our service was rather haphazard. People would order drinks and food, and get things at wildly different times. One person was done eating appetizers and drinks when another was just getting their first drink. I know there was chaos to a big party, but it got a little out of hand.\n\nThe food is pretty standard American chain food, comparable to Appleby's and Chili's - not offensive, but nothing to knock your socks off. It has a decent selection, and a few good desserts and appetizers, and everything was competently prepared. Overall, it is a fine enough meal for a large group before going to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable prices, but some of the service standards are poor. In the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurants in the area and then move over to D&B's for games.\n\nBar: 1 Star\n\nDrinks are predictably expensive, but there is a wide variety. The problem is that about half of them don't even kind of resemble what is on the menu, and most don't have enough alcohol to even taste. Worse yet, while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade, the staff is either completely non-interactive or just rude. You have to track them down, and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruined their life.\n\nArcade: 4 Stars\n\nThere are a lot of great games here to play, and many that are fun with groups or pairs. It is a great place for a large party, because you can mingle with all your friends playing many different very fun games. If you are a couple, there are also many great selections that everyone enjoys. The staff on the floor is helpful and fast to fix games that have problems, and are typically polite. The ticket prizes are cheap as expected, but kind of fun, and the people in the ticket shop were always nice and quick to help.\n\n\nOverall: 3 Stars\n\nIf you want to hang out here, I would suggest eating somewhere else, and then playing games and having fun here, but only order beer at the bar and don't expect a smile.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New"}

You were polite, you greeted us as soon as we walked in the door, gave us no qualms while ordering and were swift with your delivery.  Food, you were not wonderful.  I ordered the BBQ chicken breasts.  This came with a side of broccoli and their type of mashed potatoes.  The chicken was a bit dry and in some places you can tell it was left on the grill a little too long.  There were actually some bites that all I could taste was charred meat.  There wasn't enough BBQ sauce on the the chicken either.  The broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared.  Some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp areas on it.  Also I noticed that there were still some leaves left on the broccoli.  The mashed potatoes I wanted to like (which I hoped would be the best part of the dish, I'm a bit of a potato freak), but alas, I was let down. *sad face* They were cold and such a tiny portion.  With a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of it's container.  Oh food, how if I didn't need you to survive, I wouldn't complain about you.\n\nThe building right now is in disarray.  They are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtains covering up certain sections of their dining area.  No bar out in the dining area right now and the pool tables were absent as well.  If you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game room.\n\nSpeaking of the game room, by far the best part.  With the meal I ordered I got the $20 play card (the best part of the meal, super charge it for $3 more and it's even better).  The game room  you can tell is in need of an update.  The carpet is worn and other signs of wear are noticeable as well.  One good thing is the games.  They change them up so often that there is always something new once you return.  Who knew that playing Connect 4 could be so fun, or for that matter Skee Ball rises to the top of my list to play.\n\nI will return again, but only after I eat elsewhere first.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New"}

Speaking of that, I've been here a few times, but never wrote a review for D&B. \n\nI'm a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the games. However, there have been multiple instances where I swiped my game card & it took my credits, but no game began. There have also been times that I won and no tickets were released. I guess nothing is perfect but it does happen atleast once a visit (each scenerio)  It's hard to find a worker walking around and for half-price games, you kind of just take your loss with the 1.3 credits for skee ball (hmph!)\n\nThe food- it really isnt anything too fancy. I've had okay food, but super long wait times for a simple chicken fingers & fries for example. It's your basic sandwiches, salads, appetizers & a few pastas. I believe all sandwiches & burgers are around $10 & served with fries.  You can get the Eat & Play deal which includes food from a specific menu + a game card. Besides the game card deal, if you wanted to make D&B a date night you might be better off heading to another place to eat in Waterfront for amazing food.. but to each their own.  Try it once I suppose. The brownie sundae that i devoured last night was satisfying (2 brownies, 2 scoops of ice cream.. one with chocolate syrup; the other with raspberry sauce & fresh strawberries. Oh & whip cream)\n\nDrinks- pretty weak. We ordered 2 liquid maryjanes (2 each that is) which are filled with multiple shots of alchy & didn't really catch a buzz. Oh welllll. They do have a happy hour from 5-7pm. I'd go during that time for the best deal. I believe cocktails are half off & $3 off  bottles of wine. I've never seen anyone walking around with a wine glass though lol. \n\nThe prizes- as others have noted, the prizes are a little cheap for the amount of tickets they \"cost\" However, it's cool to leave with a D&B coffee mug, cup or shot glass. Last night for 2500 tickets we decided on magnetic-style dart board (1,300?) a coffee mug, a D&B glass (our plastic one bit the dust) & a D&B coffee travel mug.. I might be missing a few odds & ends.\n\nOverall it's a fun time but can be pricey. It's best to head here Wednesday for half price games or get the Eat & Play deal while dining. \n\nI can't lie though, I find myself smiling ear to ear a few times within those 3 hours (woah, seemed longer than amount of time :D ) Speaking of which, in that time-frame we played 250 credits (cost= $40) but it was half-price games.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New"}

It was cod (meh, that should have been the sign not to get it) with roasted asparagus and lemon rice.  The fish was suppose to be broiled but it had a thick breading (annoyed) and the portion of fish was tiny. The rice and asparagus were great though. \n\nMy friend got a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed although the fries were pathetic.  The fries were probably pre-cut frozen fries or just very poorly executed.  They were so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavor.\n\nPros: A lot of tables (no wait), brew special beers, big menu, could hear the dueling piano bar next door\n\nCons: Place was fairly empty and we got a crappy table by the door when it was 5 degrees outside, most of the food was fried, cheese filled, cream based, or wrapped in bacon.  I know some people love to eat food like this all the time( I do every once in awhile) but if you eat out a lot you can't always get the spin dip, burger, and ice cream sundae.

He a wheat beer of their brewing, me my fave Bloody Mary with Absolut Peppar.  The hubster deemed the beer acceptable, but wouldn't go out of his way to come back just for another one....yes, he DID order another one \"just to be sure.\"  My Bloody sucked.  Watered down tomato juice with no discernible Peppar of any kind, let alone any other seasonings.  Even a good standard mix would have been better.  Our very efficient and friendly waitress took it back and watched while it was remade by the other bartender.  Nope, no better at all.  That went back and I went with a you-can't-screw-it-up Amaretto sour.  It was fine.\n\nHub ordered a Reuben - why, I'll never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what used to be at the long-lamented Gazebo in Shadyside.  You younguns wouldn't have a clue of the establishment of which I speak.  He said this one was \"fine.\"  I had the Texas Fire steak with jalapeno butter which I enjoyed very much!  Packed a punch of heat and flavor, but the sides were uninspired.  Steamed veggies.  Any flavor was steamed out in the process - eh.  Cheddar mashed potatoes - there was cheddar in there?????  No way!\n\nThe tab was reasonable - we DID have a Living Social deal that took $30 off, so our check was for $12 and change, not including tip.  Not bad (even with the $15 cost of the LS Deal), but had we paid full price, it wouldn't have been worth the experience.

You get three sliders and they were very good.\n\nMy wife got a small greenhouse salad with Jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster & shrimp enchiladas as her main entree. She complained about how salty it was and the fact that there was no lobster in it at all.\n\nOur daughter got the kids burger and fries.

We put our names on the list and went shopping around the area. About 25 minutes later, our table was ready. Parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with Dave & Busters and a karaoke bar called Sing Sing. Tom dropped me off at the door so I could secure our table.\n\nOur server, Jackie, approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start. She was very attentive and funny, and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant. Tom ordered a Red Ale and to his surprise, didn't care for it. Jackie gave Tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits. He loved all three, and chose the most bizarre (and expensive) beer. Jackie switched the Red Ale to the beer of Tom's choice, and charged us for the less expensive beer. Very nice of her!\n\nWe started out with the Ball Park Pretzels with Jalapeno dip. The pretzels came out quickly and they were very fresh, not to mention huge! We only ate one and took the other to go. Very good app though! \n\nTom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger, and I got the Chicken Fried Chicken, which was a pounded chicken breast, breaded and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw.  Tom's burger came with a small handful of fries, and my meal was very spread out on my plate, like something was missing. Not very good presentation at all. The food itself was okay, nothing to write home about. The potatoes were my favorite part. Tom said that his burger was mediocre.\n\nAnother note: The bathrooms are shared with the Sing Sing karaoke bar that is in the same building, so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party...

They admittedly still aren't my first choice food-wise because, by design, they're a pretty generic eatery for the most part, especially compared to other options in the area. Their local brews are really the only thing that sets them apart from other places in the Waterfront, and Pittsburgh has so many breweries and so forth now that even that isn't the biggest draw anymore.\n\nThat said, their brews ARE usually quite good and worth trying. Plus, they ARE improving in terms of service and quality of food, and that deserves a mention. Sure, I may think their menu of burgers, pizzas and American eats is pretty average, but I also think the quality of the dishes is improving. For example, my burgers are no longer coming to me overcooked, and as a result actually taste like a burger and not like a pile of toppings and a dry meat patty. Some dishes are even more memorable now; I actually really like their veggie burger, which is packed full of flavor that even I, a known carnivore, can appreciate. And their fresh pretzels and dip? Absolutely amazing - exactly what you'd expect from a warm pretzel fresh out of the oven. \n\nI was especially impressed during my last visit by a server named Mark, who was incredibly attentive and came to our table regularly to check on drinks and keep us updated. He never said a negative word and was quick to correct any mistakes or problems that popped up during the night. If Rock Bottom hires more people like him, there will be many more happy people coming and going from the place, I guarantee it.\n\nAdd in the fact that this is one of a small handful of places that accepts reservations in the Waterfront - a MAJOR plus when planning big outings with friends in the area! - and you have a reliable place where a group of people can go after a movie, shopping, etc. for food and drinks.

Friday's. You either like it or hate it. This location is pretty standard; it has the expected mash-up of decorations around the walls that try to give the place a laid-back lounge feel and there's nothing outstanding about the menu or what they offer food wise (and like other Friday's, it's not particularly easy to eat here if you're anything other than a meat lover).\n\nHonestly I wasn't expecting to eat here any time soon; I had called a few days before eating here while planning a day out with friends and asked about reservations for a large group (as it says on the T.G.I. Friday's website that it's ideal to call ahead when you have a large party). However, I was told on the phone that this location does not accept reservations. So my friends and I looked elsewhere, and finally walked across the street to Friday's after discovering just how darn long the waits at other restaurants were. At least Friday's only had a 15 minute wait.\n\nOnce we were seated our meal went by pretty uneventfully. I remember that we had to repeat ourselves a lot to our waitress and I had wondered why she was having trouble hearing us, but at least she was willing to ask questions and clarify things as opposed to taking a potentially wrong order back to the kitchen. Kudos. The food, as I mentioned earlier, was standard T.G.I.Friday's. Nothing particularly wrong with it, just not that exciting either. I had actually found one of the only low-calorie items on the menu at the last minute - a steak and vegetable dish - and standard or not I was honestly pretty happy with it. My steak was surprisingly juicy, came out fairly pink and was not overcooked at all (I'd ordered a medium temperature steak), and the simple and tasty vegetables offered a nice alternative to some of the other excessive dishes I saw on the menu. Not that that mattered after I ordered a rum punch cocktail, which mixed so much rum, fruit juice, sprite and other sugary beverages together that my teeth probably rotted a little bit in my head. It was worth it, though - that drink was a sweet, tall cup of Heaven.\n\nThis T.G.I.Friday's really fits my exact definition of an \"a-ok\" place - it's not terrible, nor is it not exceptional. It's just a decent place to grab a bite or to enjoy a drink. I'd consider coming back again, but admit that they wouldn't be my first choice so much as a solid back-up plan for when other Waterfront eateries are super busy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tU-YtoW339PXJmUGSix_AQ"}

Reading the other reviews, it makes me wonder if people were a the same restaurant I was.  Sure, it isn't a world class dining establishment, but it is decent considering it is a chain.  You should know that going into any chain, really.  It was basically exactly what I expected in terms of food quality and price.\n\nWe were greeted immediately upon entering, and while the hostess went to grab menus, another server asked us if we were taken care of.  Service at our table was very attentive and water and other beverages were promptly refilled.  I ordered soup and two appetizers instead of an entree or pizza and the server made sure to ask me about the order in which I would prefer receiving my food.  \n\nMy fiance ordered a deep dish pizza and we know they take longer to make than other food items.  It was quicker than we thought it would be and he really enjoyed it.  I had the potato skin appetizer.  It reminds me of a \"baked potato pizza\" that I used to enjoy at a local place back in Buffalo.  It was delicious, especially with the addition of a little bit of hot sauce.\n\nOverall, it doesn't even come close to visiting an Uno's in Chicago, but then again, when does a copy every live up to the original?  It won't be a regular location in our  dining rotation, but it is good to know that when we have a craving for deep dish, Uno will do the trick and cost a lot less than a trip to Chicago.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg"}

I was seated right away, no wait. Was given a good beer selection of some PA Craft beers. Ordered the traditional deep dish pizza, but with no onions. Now after we ordered, it just went downhill from there. Was never asked if I wanted another beer, the waitress just gave me more water. My pizza still had onions in it. Which I stated right off the bat, that I didn't blame the girl who took my order. I know cooks can't read. I was one for many years. Mistakes happen, and the manger took care of it and took the item off my bill. NO complaints, still ate the food and it was good. Just not a fan of onions on my pizza. \n\nNow onto the bill, the server continues to tell me that she was sorry for the mistake and declares she told the cooks not to add onions. I already said it was taking care of and there's no worries. She goes on to say that the next day was her birthday, and if I felt like leaving all my money as a tip, it wouldn't go unnoticed. I took this as a joke as I had told her earlier I worked in the industry. When I hand over the gift card I had on hand, she comes back and again repeats herself, tells me that cash as a tip is preferred as she doesn't have to claim it at the end of the night. And again if I felt like leaving her all my money, she would just be so freaking happy. Let me explain one thing and hopefully I am very clear on it. No server, and I mean NO server anywhere, should ever ask a guest or customer for a tip, yet alone, do it twice! So out of kindness, which I shouldn't have left anything by this point. I left a nice tip for the cost of what food I did  have to pay for.\n\nBottom line, the food was good for the price, but the service from this one person as I don't know how the rest of the servers are.

I love everything about crunch crust, a nice rich tomato sauce, and a thick layer of melted cheese. I have never tried Chicago style pizza before and when we had to rescue our friends from car troubles, Uno's was right there so we decided to try it out. \n\nOnly a 30 minute wait for a Saturday is pretty good for any restaurant in the Waterfront. We were seated at a booth in the bar area. The tables were clean and it was a big booth so the four of us were not squished. Only complaint, the bar was loud and when they did blended drinks you had to pause your conversation because the blenders were so loud. Good news, only happened twice!\n\nThe four of us decided to order two pizzas, the Pepperoni and the Farmers Market. I also ordered a Caesar salad because I needed more vegetables in my life.  \n\nThe salad. It was a big salad that I shared with my boyfriend. The croutons were huge and very crunchy. The Caesar dressing was not creamy, it was vinegar based and had a little bit of a \"bite\" to it as Chris kept on saying. I thought the bite had more to do with the vinegar than anything spicy, but who am I to say.  The lettuce was fresh and crunchy and they even added tomatoes like I requested. \n\nThe main dishes came out about 10 minutes later. I do not know what I was expecting but the pizzas were not as large as I was imagining. Two of the larger pizzas looked like personal pizzas to me. But!!!! I was soon to see that even if they are a bit smaller they were filled to perfection. \n\nThe Farmers Market pizza had caramelized onions, spinach, SUN DRIED AMAZING TOMATOES, regular tomatoes, eggplant, pesto as a sauce, and a blend of cheeses. The crust was perfection being so crisp and light that I stole Chris' extra from his plate. The sun dried tomatoes were great adding just enough sweetness to the pizza that I went looking for the slices with the most on them. It was a really really good pizza. We even ended up taking slices home with us! My eyes deceived me at first with the size! \n\nThen our friends told us that we had to try the cookie pizza. Cookie pizza? What sorcery is this? Matt, the one who suggested it said that we would not be disappointed. This cookie came out in a really large, bigger than our pizzas, dish. It had three scoops of icecream on it with a pile of whipped cream. WARM, right out of the oven, fresh cookie pizza. Oh sweet heavens, it was good. I am glad that I had enough room in my stomach to pile in that sweet goodness. \n\nChicago Pizza, I would absolutly try again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg"}

Dining here brought back memories of an excellent meal I enjoyed in Chicago last month at Uno subsidiary, Pizzeria Due.\n\nThe restaurant is attractive and comfortable, and the outdoor seating by the river a delight.  The tables outside, though, are too close and if all are occupied, one can hear every word of what is said at neighboring tables.\n\nThe spinach and chicken pizza, appetizers of zucchini chips and spinach and artichoke dip were all delicious, but the zucchini was extremely salty.\n\nOur server was pleasant and attentive, performing many quality checks.  $20.99 is a lot to pay for a pizza, but the deep dish pies are hearty and plenty for two people. $7.75 for a small glass of house wine is excessive.  The $4.99 tariff for the single serving appetizers was fair for the quality and the portion sizes.\n\nThe weak link was the young lady who seated us.  She was glum, unfriendly, and without a smile.  Instead of saying \"Enjoy your meal\" when seating customers, she says, \"There you are.\"  How a customer is greeted can set the tone for a meal and this is an important facet of the front of the house operation. At The Cheesecake Factory, the host staff is trained to engage the customer in pleasant conversation while leading the guest to the table. The individual at Uno got us off to a poor start.  A nice touch would be for a manager to provide a quality check and make the diner feel welcome.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg"}

One of the \"special\" dishes offered tonight consisted of chicken, Yukon Gold potatoes, and some sort of sauce.  YOUKON GOLD?!!  Do you eat those potatoes with rice?  My order of Singapore noodles had French fried onions on top.  With curry powder. (I assume it was powder, because the menu promised curry but there was no sauce.)\n\n     The restaurant is half-full on a Thursday night, but noisy with at least three decades of American top-40 music blaring non-stop.  The bar is large, the beer glasses are tall and thin, but there's not  a Tsing Tao or plum wine in sight.  This is as US as a place can get.\n\n     But here's the thing:  the French fried onions are crispy and spicy. We order a $5.00 plate of garlic sugar-snap peas and that's exactly what we get:  snap peas stir-fried for not more than two minutes in a little oil, a lot of garlic and probably a pinch of salt.  This is a fresh, simple, tasty treat and it's matched by the broccoli that comes with the broccoli and chicken dish.  The sauce is blandly acceptable, but the broccoli is emerald green and abundant.  \n\n     I hate the PF Chang ritual where they mix their own special sauce for you, as though you are incapable of mixing soy and chili paste yourself.  Worse, it seems to imply that the food they're serving will be so tasteless it will need all the help it can get from this spicy concoction.  But once the wait staff departs, I just ignore the mess and forget my irritation.  Because, much as I hate to admit it, the food, although about as Asian as the plastic chop sticks they distribute, is fresh, tasty and well-presented.  The staff remembers to re-fill the water glasses.  I'd love to give this place two starts but I keep going back, so I have to give it three, or I'm a chump.  But I'll be damned if I call it an Asian food restaurant.\n\nP.S.    I probably must mention that Ben Roethlisberger was coming in to PF Changs just as I was leaving.  With a good-looking woman.

I wish I could give 2.5 stars, but I'm in a good mood so I'm rounding up today. \n\nThis was my first time here and I honestly wasn't sure what to expect. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the layout of the dining area. It seemed less intimate than I had pictured in my mind. The tables were all jammed together and the restaurant had a crowded feel to it. Fortunately, there wasn't a long wait as we had made a reservation. \n\nWe were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room alongside a busy throughway. It seemed all the servers were destined to walk past our table. I appreciated that their menu pointed out that their meals were \"meant to be shared.\" My wife and I decided to share our two meals: Chang's Spicy Chicken and Double Pan Fried Noodles. Before our meal came out our waitress set some sauces on the table in a \"here's your sauce\" kind of way. I remember thinking, \"That's very nice, but I have no idea why you just gave us sauce.\" There was no explanation - just a little tray of sauces. Our food came out and she finally asked if we like mild, medium, or hot sauce. We picked medium and, with a few scoops, she turned our three sauces into three mixed sauces and I still didn't know what they were for. \n\nForget the sauce though, my attention was now drawn to our meal. For meals that were \"meant to be shared\" these sure are little portions. I guess when you go for that high-end presentation you can charge 50% more for 50% less. The food itself was good (in an ok sort of way). I can't say it was the best I've had, but it was good enough. \n\nOverall I thought the experience was lacking. P.F. Chang's tries to be classy, but does it in a cafeteria sort of way. I was constantly distracted by the front doors opening and icy air pouring across the room. The music didn't fit the ambiance. Our table felt like it was in the middle of the road. The restaurant was loud and crowded. The girls at the table next to us were taking those annoying duck-face puckered lip pictures...  \n\nI think our experience may have been different if we were seated at one of the booths along the side of the restaurant, but no such luck.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JDDeaNfb0JXD1NbznSIC9g"}

Chang's is poorly set up as one large open room that's rather noisy. Food came out quickly but was not as good as the Chinese take out we get from sesame inn. Spicy chicken was neither spicy nor very flavorful and had a mass-produced feel to it. Took half home to eat the next day but ended up throwing it out a few days later. Normally one of the great thing about getting Chinese is looking forward to the leftovers the next day!   Another minus was noticing how dirty the floor was on the way back to the bathroom. I don't expect a place to be immaculate in the middle of dinner service but this looked like the mcdonalds on Smithfield downtown.\nThe one bright spot was our waitress was very good and kept our water glasses filled. We just came from kennywood so we went through quite a few fill ups during our time there. Short of this, I'd probably give Changs two stars. Probably last time I'll stop in here unless I can't get in to any restaurants in the area and need a place I know won't be too busy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JDDeaNfb0JXD1NbznSIC9g"}

It wasn't too noisy or too crowded, and we were seated right away on a Friday around 7:30 pm.\n\nOur server was friendly, and happy to give recommendations.  I started with a house salad, which I told the server I would split with my boyfriend.  She brought it to us on two separate plates, which I thought was a nice touch, and more than what I expected.  Poppy seed dressing was okay, it's pretty thick and creamy as I remember, but tasty.\n\nI ordered from the special menu, since they had a bit of a lobster promotion going on.  My entree was a combo: lobster tail, and \"lobster pot pie.\"  Now, lobster is a beautiful thing, but I have to say....it wasn't beautiful here.  It wasn't awful, but it didn't taste as fresh as I like (I'm guessing that's because the meat was frozen originally).  It's just a shame.  Dipping the lobster in butter was a pleasant experience, but it's supposed to be an ecstatic one.\n\nThe lobster pot pie was totes not what I imagined.  I pictured a flaky, golden crust, a delicious creamy lobstery gravy, and big hunks of lobster and vegetables.  Instead....I got what sort of resembled a small bread bowl made of a biscuit.  There was a lot of sauce, which was surprisingly orange in color and very rich, with some lobster chunks and vegetables that appeared to come from a bag of frozen veg (I'd recognize those tiny square-shaped carrot chunks anywhere)!  Whaaaaaaaat?  It wasn't bad or anything, but not what I imagined.  I was a little bummed out.  \n\nSo everything we ate was just fine, and nice when you're craving seafood....but I think in future I'd rather just head to the Strip, get a lobster, and cook the sucker up myself.  I didn't try their fresh preparations, so I can't say how those were.\n\nI'd say in the Waterfront though, it's probably one of your better options.

I'm always surprised that more chips are not just added to the original dish at this point. Dip was good. Calamari was done well. Preferred the shrimp cocktail Sauce with it versus the Asian type soy sauce that is served with it. \n\nWedge salad with bleu cheese. Waaaaaay too much cheese and I like bleu cheese. \n\nI had the blackened tuna with mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies. Carrots were carrot sticks hardly cooked and dry! Green beans overdone and broccoli had seen better days. Simple green beans would have been more appetizing. \nTuna had blackening spices but needed a better sear on it. Was not over cooked. Potatoes as expected. \nOther dishes seen--fisherman's platter. Looked a little greasy, but that's expected from me in a full fried dish. Would be nice if this was offered broiled as well. Crab cakes and filet looked okay. \n\nOverall I'm always underwhelmed and overcharged here. I guess with chain places you get that, but I want more from a place that charges me 25 bucks for sub-seared tuna.", "type": "review", "business_id": "usSROUMiAgPcxV3Ym0OxMQ"}

It's a little kitchy, red-white-and-green, with Dino and Frankie tunes playing in the background.\n\nI've stopped in on several occasions now for dinner, with various friends, and the food has been consistent...it's good...satisfying. Not over-the-top gourmet, or even in the remotest sense 'pretentious'.

The service is decent, kind of point blank, not rude, nor over the top friendly. \n\nThe crowd can fluctuate between 'Oh my god, I'm surrounded by Hillbillies' to 'the local gathering at Mayberry', but that seems to be the norm for most places in da burgh.\n\nI've not had the pizza, which apparently get raves, because frankly I only think of pizza as coming in a box to my front door when I'm too lazy to do any cooking at home.

I was in a good mood though, so the attitude over the phone didn't bother me. Price was good, typical takeout rates. The good news is that they will allow you to pay with credit cards over the phone, so if you're like me and never carry cash, you can still get delivery. She told me 45 minutes for the food.\n\nThe food arrived in about 20 minutes (we live half a mile away), it was hot and smelled great. Hubby's Mei Fun looked typical, but he was saddened to see that they didn't exchange the white sauce for brown sauce. The beef was pretty mushy, and didn't taste all that great. The veggies were fresh, and pretty crispy even after soaking in sauce. Noodles were alright, nothing to write home about. My General Tso tofu was delicious, and tasted exactly like the dish I was craving. Fried to perfection, perfect-sized pieces of tofu, and a fantastic sauce. The broccoli was fresh and tasted good. This particular dish only came in one size: Enormous. I think hubby and I just ended up sharing my meal, paired with some mediocre egg rolls.\n\nSo, long story short, lady on the phone was a bit irritating, delivery was fast, food was fresh, and, depending on what you order, the food quality ranges from so-so to great.

Bellevue does seem to have a small collection of decent eats at reasonable prices, and The Rusty Nail is one of that handful of good examples of neighborhood haunts.\n\nIt's touted as a 'diner' in many of the reviews, but it really is a step above your average 'diner', and is more of a cozy neighborhood gathering spot for a decent burger, or entree. I've not made it there for the breakfast, but have always been satisfied by the dinners.\n\nRusty Nail is hardly on the gourmet end of the scale. In fact, I would imagine the Sysco truck pulls up out back regularly with deliveries of food parts, from cans of sauces to frozen animal chunks. As long as those parts are assembled and doctored to make them seem a bit fresher than the typical conveyor-belt diner, all is fine.

Period.\n\nBurgers, meatloaf, pot roast, fish sammiches, salads, pastas...a varied but adequate menu. Fair and decent prices. Friendly and attentive service. A cozy enough atmosphere (although I have to say AGAIN in a review of a restaurant, if you've got multiple TVs in the space, for gods sake, can ONE of them NOT be showing SPORTS coverage??) and a pleasant crowd of patrons. \n\nDuring my last visit, there was a large family gathering at the next table. A nicely polished middle-class clan, ranging in age from gramps to granddaughter. At one point, dad received a phone call on his cell...and actually stepped OUTSIDE to have his conversation. As I was leaving I had to pat him on the back and thank him for being one of the few remaining decent guys with manners!\n\nBottom line...Rusty Nail is comfortable. It's not a drive-out-of-you-way destination for dining. It is what it is. A great little neighborhood spot FOR the neighborhood. \n\nBut do bring cash. The don't take credit cards.

The prices aren't the cheapest, but for what it is Pino's delivers small plates and dinners that are satisfying without breaking the bank. The lamb bolognese is one of my personal favorites, as well as pretty much any of the appetizers. I also love the creative cocktail list and the half price bottles of wine for happy hour. There are few places in Pittsburgh that can get me as excited about cocktails as Pino's. My roommate and I have come here with friends and sat at the bar for hours eating and drinking a variety of delightful things. In short, they do drinks and food quite well for the price. \n\nThe reason Pino's only gets three stars is the unfortunate inconsistency with service I've encountered. I get treated differently depending on who I come in with, and that's unprofessional. If I'm with my roommate and one of my friends (both of whom work nearby) we all get seated quickly and treated extremely well. In short, it feels like my presence is valued. When I've come to Pino's with people who aren't in with the owners though, I've had a thoroughly lackluster experience. Once I came on my birthday with my boyfriend and frankly was let down. We waited awkwardly for a very long time to be seated even though there were empty tables and in general had a very impersonal experience. I felt embarrassed having spoken so highly of Pino's to him beforehand. I know I'll be back for the occasional happy hour or small dinner, but Pino's isn't somewhere I would take anyone I wanted to impress due to the problematic service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZL6DNzyenFm9Kpz6uADlNg"}

For me, personally, it's one of the best places to catch an NFL game...especially if you're not a Steelers fan. On any given Sunday, you'll find fans of just about every team in the NFL taking in a game, so the atmosphere is a positive one. Seating is the only issue. Get there early or you might end up standing to see your particular game, as seating can be a premium by the time the games begin. Luckily, the TV's (there are lots of them) are all labeled with the day's matchups, so finding the game you're looking for isn't a problem.\n\nThe draft beer selection usually has something for everyone, from local craft brews by East End Brewing, to seasonals and your simpler standards (hello, PBR), so if you're a beer person, you won't be disappointed.\n\nAs far as service goes, it's hit-or-miss. I've had mostly great service at the bar, but I've also had average to below average service at tables. During bigger sporting events - primarily Steelers games - the service can be even more iffy due to the sheer volume of people in the bar area.\n\nOverall, I have to rate the food as average. I LOVE their boneless wings, and their wing sauces are all very excellent. Their pulled pork is really tender and delicious, as well, but most of their sandwiches and burgers are simply average. The fries can be either really good, or too soggy and greasy. I think the inconsistency in the quality of the cooking is the main issue. The menu reads really well, which raises your expectations, but sometimes the execution will leave you a little disappointed. It's never horrible, but you'll rarely be blown away by your meal.\n\nIn the end, I'm giving Buffalo Blues a higher rating based on the experience during sporting events, which, let's face it, is the real draw of a \"sports bar.\" As far as sports bars go, it's my favorite place to catch a game. They always get a good crowd for games (whether Sundays during the NFL season, Saturdays during big college games, or for Pens games), and if you stick to the wings and beer, odds are your experience will be great. There's a good chance that you can go in and find fans of your team if you're an out-of-towner looking for a game, and the crowd is much more accepting, friendly, and relaxed than the crowds I've experience in other sports bars in town. Most of my average experiences revolved around non-game times when you try to get a more traditional meal and realize that there are just better options in Shadyside for lunch and dinner.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg"}

Just a fine sports bar - no more, no less.\n\nI'll start with the drinks.  They have a good draft selection, and supposedly they've got a nice bottle list too, though I didn't have a look at it, so I can't judge; and the Happy Hour special compliments it well ($1 off all drinks 5PM-7PM).   Plus they have East End drafts at $3/glass all the time, though they were out of Big Hop (the only East End choice they have) when I was there (I don't know if this is a regular occurrence, but if it is, they better do something about it).  The bartenders were friendly and quick to serve, qualities that carried over to the food service as well.\n\nThe menu has a pretty good selection of pub-y and Southwestern-themed foods from which I picked the black bean and corn quesadilla.  Although at the end I was running low on guacamole (which is $1 extra for a small cup) and sour cream, this is a small quibble.  The meal overall  was good, and since I got it with the happy hour special, I can't complain.  One thing I will mention is that there aren't too many vegetarian choices on the menu (I'm not vegetarian, but I try not to eat too much meat, so I notice these things), so if you're a vegetarian, I would try to look up the menu beforehand just to be sure there's something for you.\n\nI know I haven't said much negative about Buffalo Blues in this review, yet I'm still giving it only three stars.  This is the kind of place that makes me appreciate the \"word versions\" of the ratings that Yelp gives us.  \"A-OK,\" which, if you didn't know, is how Yelp describes three-star reviews, is exactly how I would describe Buffalo Blues.  The comparison I keep going to in my head is Die Hard 2.  It's not nearly as good as its predecessor, but it's still something I'm fine with popping in every once in a while when there's nothing better to watch.\n\nTo sum it up - I'm not a big sports guy.  Buffalo Blues, though it is a sports bar, is not the place that would sway me to go to watch a game there with my friends (I'll still say that some kind of playoff game of the Steelers-Ravens I watched at Big Jim's was one of the best sports-watching experiences of my life).  And, judging it as a sports bar, it didn't do anything to justify my giving it anything but \"just fine.\"  But I'm sure I'll go back there for happy hour again sometime.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg"}

I'll say up front: I only ever go there on Sundays for football, and I would never go there for any other reason.  It is the only bar I know of in the city where you can reliably find every NFL game televised and enjoy your Sunday if you're not a Steelers fan.  Pretty much every team is represented by the crowd on Sundays, with a disproportional number of Bills and Redskins fans.  The crowd is generally friendly, with many of the same faces from week to week.\n\nThey tend to have a wide selection of beers that rotates pretty regularly, but wide selection doesn't always mean good selection.  That said, sometimes they get some really great beers that you wouldn't expect to find at a sports bar.  Whatever you do, don't order a bloody Mary, they're atrociously bad.  The staff is almost universally friendly, with the exception of one barback who seems to always be in a bad mood and rude to customers (he often takes over as bartender later in the day on Sundays).  That said, the wait staff don't seem to know much about the food or beers that are offered, often mis-characterizing new beers that are on tap or giving wrong information about things on the menu.\n\nThe food is mediocre and over-priced.  When two of us go for one game on a Sunday, drink 3-4 beers each and each order an entr\u00e9e, we generally end up with a tab in the $80-90 range, depending on what we're drinking that day.  In a city that is almost universally accommodating to vegetarians, this place is most decidedly not.  They have a veggie burger which is actually pretty good, but it's the only decent thing on the menu for a vegetarian to eat (there is also a grilled cheese sandwich and a veggie sandwich, both of which are bland to the point of tasteless.  It's like eating plain bread).  They have 4 entr\u00e9e salads, and every one of them has meat as a defining ingredient.  They don't even have beans so you could have decent veggie nachos.  I know, it's a sports bar, but I don't want to eat the same veggie burger every Sunday for 17 weeks.  It gets old.  Fast.\n\nUpshot?  In the absence of a new sports bar opening up, we'll be back next season, but not before then.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg"}

We'd bought a few growlers of hard cider from a local establishment, and we were looking for some fuel to help us soak up the booze.  My friend suggested getting pizza from here, and I didn't object, since I'd never had pizza from here before, and I'd heard the pizza from here was consistently decent.\n\nThe pizza showed up about 45 min. after we ordered it, right about at the time estimated, so no complaints there.  As for the pizza itself, it was solidly A-OK--nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  It was a bit on the greasy side, and I could tell from pulling the first piece away from the pie that the crust wasn't crispy.  Biting into my first slice of pepperoni pizza confirmed my suspicions about the floppiness of the crust.  As for the flavor, it was your standard pizza flavor--again, nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.

It is a good, if unspectacular place with reliable, tasty fare like honey chicken, Chinese flank steak, and authentic eggrolls.  \n\nI don't normally go for the spicy fare, indeed I prefer the plainer dishes like chicken with vegetables, but they have one item on the menu that I've always wanted to try--Sau La Gi, which is stir-fried hot spicy chicken, onions, green onions & fresh bean sprouts.  Perhaps I've never noticed, but I don't recall seeing it anywhere else.  It was good, but Hoo-Boy did I have to pace myself while eating it.  And have plenty of water nearby!  Sau La Gi was worth trying once, but it really wasn't to my tastes and I doubt I'll have it again.\n\nMy friend Maryann tried  Ching Za Gai (spicy also) which is roasted crispy chicken served with tangy vinaigrette sauce.  I sampled it and perhaps I will order that for myself next time.  I'd like to cook a milder version of it myself at home.  \n\nMore to my tastes however are the Garden Chicken, Chicken with Broccoli, or Beef with Pea Pods.  Seafood dishes include Sweet and Sour Shrimp and  Sauteed Shrimp Szechaun Style.  Yeah, I'm a little unimaginative when it comes to Chinese food, but I know what I like and if a place can do the basics right, it's okay in my book!\n\nJimmy Tsang's also has a convenient and inexpensive lunch menu.  The place also does Korean Barbecue and you can book a private dining room for you and your special someone with a $100 deposit.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tvXTHj9V5sgRoeVJW_FiTg"}

The lamb was tender and moist, and the mac n cheese was a tiny tube pasta with a very nice creamy cheesy sauce, all topped with a bread crumb covering when it was broiled until crispy.  It was accompanied by a 'pinch' of mesclun salad topped with another pinch of fried onions.\n\nBasically - take one large spoonful of mac n cheese with a higher end cheese sauce and a fancier noodle than comes in the average box - mix in about four cubes of roast lamb, sprinkle on a layer of bread crumbs and toss it in the broiler until the crumbs are toasted - then using your index finger and thumb, pick up a pinch of mesclun and sit it on the plate next to the mac n cheese bowl - and you have a bistroid expensive art project on a plate.\n\nSeriously? $15 for lunch? It's mac n cheese people!\n\nI also have to call into question the name and theme.  Mad Mex is bistroid Tex Mex.  Soba is bistroid Asian.  Kaya is bistroid Caribbean-ish.  Casbah? Farm Lamb mac n cheese? Sure, I can see this as a box lunch while riding a camel through the desert...not.\n\nI can't say the experience was awful. The company was awesome, and we had a nice unpressured amount of time for fun chat.  The atmosphere was comfortable, and the food was tasty.  But was it all worthy of a return trip or recommendation?  I honestly can't say 'yes' with any kind of cheerleader rave.  \n\nI'm not quite sure that I comprehend the mindset of people in this burgh who think paying that kind of money for food is worth it, when honestly, food with just as much flavor can be found in abundance around town for half the price and twice the portion. \n\nWho are all of these easily dupe-able rich people, and where do they come from? Want to blow that kind of money? Get out your check book and let me give you my address!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}

My wife and I went to Casbah for the first time.  As we usually do, we decided to share our entrees (TIP - you can get half portion sizes of the pastas!!) and augment the meal with a few appetizers.  For the appetizers, we got the chickpea flatbread, the arugula salad and the sea scallops.  The flatbread and salad were just OK.  The sea scallops would have been delicious except for the \"cured egg yolk\" which was infused in the avacado sauce.  For those who have never tried a cured egg yolk, I would consider yourself lucky.  Actually, the taste wasn't too bad.  The smell, however, reminded me of what you would smell if you were on the set of a nasty version of a Hoarders TV episode.  Must be an acquired taste.\n\nFor the main course, we chose the short rib ravioli and the cavatelli.  Both were excellent, especially the ravioli.  No complaints at all.\n\nOverall, a very pleasant experience.  Good atmosphere.  Our waitress was very friendly.  The place was busy and had a nice vibe to it.

My biggest gripe with Casbah is that it's Casbah Mediterranean when the menu (at least on this night, but I don't think it changes all that much) offers very authentic Mediterranean dishes.  One lamb dish (not overly Mediterranean) and no couscous or tagine, which are major staples of Mediterranean cuisine.  Even a side of hummus and pita or veggies would be nice.  Nonetheless, the menu has lots of fine options, just none that I've seen in a typical Mediterranean joint.  I think it's a little misleading especially if you're seeking Mediterranean cuisine.\n\nWe sampled several of the cocktails, all of which were creative and well priced.  As for food, we split the bruschetta (prosciutto and blue cheese), meatballs (pork) and the brussel sprouts were quite tasty, beet salad, and the potato gnocchi. So lots of food!  All was freshly prepared with quality ingredients and served with sophisticated presentation.\n\nLots of fine restaurants opening in the area, but it's clear to see that they have a loyal following.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}

Sea scallops that I have ordered last time were burned outside and rubbery and chewy inside. Risotto from my previous try was falling apart. But the most annoying thing is that there is way, way too much food on the plate for fine dining place. The appetizer cheese platter that we ordered last time had enough cheese to last for a week! I don't go to places like that to stuff myself... So no, I do not like it overall.

Casbah is a whopping .2 miles from home (that's at least a thousand feet!) so while its convenience and accepting of reservations reign high on my list of must-haves, the food left me slightly disappointed.  Considering the price point here, we've dropped a star level or so.\n\nI made reservations for brunch (definitely do this; the place was full when we arrived at noon) and strolled through the patio(?) area to the actual(?) restaurant.  That set up is strange itself; especially with no indication of where I'm headed.  We were quickly seated in close quarters with our other lovely brunch eating brethren.  Service was fine.  We're easy guests, and our waiter was more than tolerant with the +1 having not scoured the menu to make sure he would like something there like I had.  We both opted to go with the prix fixe; with most items hitting the halfway point, 28 bucks seemed great for including an appetizer and cocktail.\n\nMy bellini was done right.  Fancy style, making all the schnapps (ha! sorry).  The appetizer of granola with a lil' yogurt that seemed more like cream cheese fatty goodness than the very vanilla yoplait lite I typically let myself have; a sprinkling of berries hit the spot.  Sweet enough for me--maple-y and rich--and didn't even for a second seem like someone poured some Nature Valley in a bowl.  The +1 ordered the cinnamon killed polenta and couldn't get enough.. so I barely got any.\n\nOur entrees though are a different story.  +1 got the mushroom and goat omelet with his little roasted potatoes and his little sausage and his little toast and was all happy enough with it. I am not so easy, I guess.  The brioche French toast sounded great.  Caramelized pear! Sold!  I received, next to a large, meaty chicken sausage link, a few small pieces of fruit and one slice of French toast.  How is that a thing?  Maybe this is the husky child in me, but I was not expecting one slice.  Luckily with the prix fixe, there was no way I would have been able to eat more than one, but really.  If I had only ordered that at some double-digit menu price, I would not be a happy camper.\n\nOverall, really, it was fine.  The food was actually better than I make it sound; it just didn't hit the expectations everyone had set for me.  The hungry girl me will always require more than one slice of sugar bread.  Curiosity of dinner with reservations might bring me back if I don't want to make the trek elsewhere with February arctic conditions again, maybe.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}

It is my birthday month and Big Burrito offers a great deal for anyone who is on their mailing list, providing their patrons with a free entr\u00e9e up to $30.00 at any of their locations beside Umi.  I chose Casbah since I have been to all of them but this one.\n\nOur reservations were early at 5pm on a Sunday.  We arrived seated quickly in their outside seating area, which is very nice.  We were brought some water while we reviewed the menu.  I decided to start with a Manhattan to drink.  It was very nice, and strong.  Next we decided to order.  Earlier I looked online at their menu and I decided I would be ordering either the Cioppino, littleneck clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, halibut, grilled sourdough -32 or their Long Island Duck, roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, lavender, peaches, duck jus- 29.  I have had the duck dish at Soba before and loved it, but I wanted to try the Cioppino despite that, since I also love seafood and shellfish.  This I would discover was a mistake.  My partner got the Pork Chop dinner.  We placed our orders and waited.\n\nDuring our wait they brought some bread.  It was a nice touch; the bread was warm and served with two types of spreads.  By the time our entr\u00e9es came I wanted another drink and asked for Boyd and Basil - 10 Boyd & Blair vodka, fresh lemon, basil, soda, Angostura bitters, this was one of their signature cocktails.  So we began to eat.  The scallops in the dish were excellent.  Perfect sear and seasoned, as well as the shrimp.  The tiny piece of halibut in the dish and I mean tiny, was so overcooked.  I choked it down but completely unappealing and tiny.  The sauce in this fish soup was also not that great.  The dish came with bread to soak up the juices but the bread itself was burnt and hard.  It actually hurt my mouth to bite it and that was after dipping it in the juices.  I was going to ask for more bread, hold the burn, but our server had not come back.  So I finished the meal and said forget it.  \n\nAt this point the drink I ordered was still not delivered.  I was done eating and had to use the restroom so I told my husband if he came back without my drink to tell him forget it and just bring the check.  When I got back to the table that was indeed what happened.  Except he told him he was sorry and if we ordered dessert he would comp my drink.  So when he finally returned, he ordered the Chocolate Cheese Cake Bombe, Pinotage syrup & whipped cream, hazelnuts, praline ice cream, gastrique, when the waiter asked me I simply said no thank you, can I just have the drink I ordered?  He brought dessert and my drink and explained it was \"on the house, and it was their/his fault.\"  No biggy really, I was way more annoyed with my meal.  I think what really bothered me was one, how small the entr\u00e9e was.  It was more suited to be a lunch portion in my opinion.  And then how much it was, but I did have the coupon so I guess I can't complain that much about that.  Simply put if I had spent $32.00 on the meal I got I would have been very upset.  Lastly, the halibut was so overcooked and dry, same with the toast, and the sauce wasn't that pleasant.  All in all I wish I would have gone with the duck.

But compared to the many other veggie restaurants I've been to in this past, this place is average. It's really hit and miss with their dishes. When at a veggie place, I usually try to change it up each time I go to keep my diet varied. This has proven to be a little difficult at Quiet Storm because it seems every other time I get something I don't like. Apple Panini is amazing. Nachos are great! Curry wasn't spicy enough. Grits runny. Milkshakes YUM! I feel like the cooks don't have a good handle on cooking tofu there. Different dishes require tofu to be cooked for different lengths of time and it different sauces, and it has always tasted bizarre when I get it there. Sometimes its not pressed and cooked long enough. Sometimes its dried out! How can tofu get dried out? This is coming from someone who LOVES tofu. I can eat silken tofu straight out of the package with a little soy sauce and sugar.\nIf you have spent anytime in Portland, Oregon... the atmosphere in this place is very Portland. Outdoorsy hipster cafe style. It's loud, but I couldn't imagine it another way. They also have pinball, which is awesome.

That's an unpleasant prospect to face down after a hard night of drinking, which is the only time the idea of brunch ever occurs to me.  But then, the grim Spectre of Laziness appeared to me and asked, \"Do you really want to drive to another place?  Just look at you. Your wearing the same shirt that you wore yesterday dude.\"  \n\nThe Spectre of Laziness is a dick, but he was also right.  And to my surprise, nothing I had was bad at all.  For brunch options, meat eaters will find that potatoes and eggs are the cornerstone of any breakfast, and seitan substitutions are not as bad as say, having the grim Spectre of Laziness point out your slovenly appearance.  \n\nI think the biggest surprise in this place is that, though nothing is particularly jarring to the palate, there is nothing that really stands out as being amazing.  In Yelp terms: it's kind of a 3.  For hard core vegetarians having a night, er, mid-afternoon on the town, it's probably a blessed change from the meat based culture that Pittsburgh is pretty famous for.  But I'm willing to wager that very meat eaters will become converted to vegetarians after this.  Maybe they did TOO good of a job substituting meat items.  That being said, we did make it back another time for lunch where I had a vegetarian gyro.  My friend said it best: \"What's the fucking point?\"\n\nThe service is always very sweet, but both times the waiters have been curiously, nay ominously spacey.  Even when it wasn't crowded there had to be some substantial flag downs and polite and doleful eye contact before they would do what you needed.

However, 20 some-odd bites in to the dish, the flavors were getting repetitive and the mushy texture started to gross me out.  I got about half-way through eating the dish and the so-so aioli became too much for me.  I couldn't take another bite.\n\nHowever, my wife's apple panini was delicious.  I would probably eat a few of those if I came back.  The cream cheese, cinnamon (from the bread?), and apple all worked together in glorious harmony.\n\nOn a strange note, while we were eating, some camera guys came in and started setting up what looked to be an interview.  We asked the staff what was going on.  Apparently someone was filming their submission/application to be on a reality show.  \"Oh cool,\" we thought.  \"What reality show?\" we asked.  \"Not sure, something on the Golf Channel,\" they replied.  HAHAHAHA!  I thought watching grass growing on TV was boring enough.  Now they're making a reality show about it.\n\nIn the end,  the gross aioli was inexcusable to me.

Folks working were vegan-hipster quirky, but friendly and helpful.  We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for our food, so we decided to partake in an afternoon coffee to pass the time.  I  had an iced Morroccan latt\u00e9 with cardamom and rose,  husband the Mandorla sweet almond milk latt\u00e9.  Both were excellent.\n\nFor my meal I picked the Tahini Bowl with brown rice, spinach, roasted red pepper, tomatoes, pepitas and fried tofu cutlet with a tahini dressing.  I wished there had been less rice and more dressing; the bowl was also screaming for more seasoning.  Husband opted for the Crunch Wrap Extreme: scrambled tofu tossed with celery, carrots, edamame, kale and spinach, dressed with vegan wasabi mayo.  Again, twice as much dressing would have added flavor and moisture to an otherwise fine wrap.\n\nAnd that's just it: the food at Quiet Storm is fine.

It seems that breakfast or brunch could be a smashing hit here but after my dinner, which I was so looking forward to, I'm not positive that I'm prepared to put this adventure at the top of my list.", "type": "review", "business_id": "l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg"}

After being \"pizza'd out,\" we decided to try Miaetta's due to their $20 deal (wings, hoagie, fries and a soda). \n\nThe food was good. Nothing spectacular. The wings were sort of dainty, though I feel they compensated by giving us more than a dozen. The garlic parm sauce was also very light. They could have been a bit more generous. We ordered the Miaetta hoagie which was pretty much like a club. Once again, good but nothing to write home about. I could have made the same sandwich myself. Fries were standard. One thing to add - I found it strange that they only had four sodas to choose from: Pepsi, Mt. Dew, a generic juice and something else. \n\nConsidering this place is extremely close to us, I would stop back to try other things on the menu. According to the other reviews on Yelp, their gourmet Italian food is what they're known for. Now we know what to order next time. My boyfriend said the scene on the inside was very old fashioned and homey, so I'd love to check them out again but perhaps dining in rather than take-out.

I have never eaten there before last night, but I have eaten at Davio's and that is what the atmosphere reminded me of.. we were there a total of 3 hours start to finish.. 3 hours until our main course was served. But, many courses are served as you wait... most of them were delicious. They bring you out fresh, delicious, warmed bread at the beginning with a garlic oil sauce dubbed \"holy oil\" and it truly is heavenly. They also have a bowl of cheese and garbanzo beans to eat atop of the bread. Delicious. There is also a cheesy spread available. All were wonderful. Then about 45 minutes later, they brought our appetizer. It was a soupy-looking mushroom appetizer with a sweet flavor. I do not recommend this app. It wasn't good. Then about 35 minutes after that, a salad was served. It came dressed and was one of the best I've had. 35-45 minutes after that, the HIGHLIGHT of the dinner came. Pasta in a bowl. It was the best part of the dinner. Finally another long time after that - our main course came. Mine looked only slightly better than it tasted. I got the seafood diavolo and it was a huge disappointment.\n I really liked our waiter - he was very busy but attentive - but I cursed him under my breath for recommending this main course. I was so close to ordering a pasta dish, which I'm certain I would have loved and devoured. But I was talked out of ordering pasta, because pasta comes with dinner. I wish our waiter would have asked me what I liked; sauces, etc before recommending this dish. $68 for something you give to your cat is a hard pill to swallow. I love seafood, but I enjoy it in butter sauces, lemony butter sauces, Alfredo sauces, wince sauces with garlic... not this red soupy dish.\n It was literally like eating cold tomatoes and water with Tabasco sauce poured in. It looked like \"seafood soup.\" All the delicious seafood was drowning in a dark red, spicy, soupy mess. I wanted to cry when I saw it.. then I tasted it and really wanted to cry. It was gross. This is the last dish I would have ever ordered had I known how it was presented. I looked around at my date who had a massive veal tenderloin in front of him and I was so jealous.. wishing I had went with my first instinct - the pasta - or even the Halibut.. anything that wasn't drowning in a spicy red soup. I just hope that staff read this and never recommend this dish to a first-timer.. especially someone who enjoys seafood they can actually TASTE that isn't drowning in some spicy tomato sauce. If this dish wasnt so awful, I would have given 5 stars. The only other bad dish was the mushroom appetizer, and it was also a soupy mess. but, i would eat the mushroom app 3 times a day for the rest of my life if it came down to that and the seafood diavolo.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

It's been a few years, and we figured, the Saturday after Thanksgiving would be perfect for italian - a welcome break from turkey.\n\nUnexpected, and awful problem with our experience.\n\nOur party of nine was seated onetime for our 5 pm reservation.  Drink orders were taken, bread and assorted accoutrements of oil and such were brought to the table.  Waitress was pleasant, holiday tunes playing (over 6 separate speakers in the small upstairs bar/table area - quality sound, something I appreciate) and muted Penn State football game on the flat screen.  We were settled in for a good meal.  \n\nAppetizers arrived approximately an hour later.  They were quite good.  The 12 ounce meatball was fantastic.  It was covered in a great tomato sauce, and hit the spot.   We ordered the calamari, and even a second round of the prosciutto wrapped prawns.  Pasta arrived - it was good, but it should be at Ala Famiglia.  \n\nThe dinners arrived at 7:25.   Yes, it was a 5:00 reservation.  At least it gave our Brunello time to breath.   The portions were big.  Lots of veal dishes, rib eyes, and filets.   Non cooked too long, or too short.  \n\nSo why the mediocre review?  The long wait?  No.   We were in good company, and enjoyed being together.  The problem was the large number of fruit flies that were all over our table.  I first noticed them in one of the empty cocktail glasses.  They liked the remnants of the Manhattan - and the cherry left in the glass.   Three of them dead, two more flew away when I waived my hand.  \n\nThat caused me to look over at my wine glass holding the $140 per bottle Brunello......yep, one dead, and one alive.  What do you do?  I fished out the dead one, and covered my glass with a cocktail napkin.  This was pretty disgusting.  We mentioned it to the waitress, but she didn't respond or summon a manager.  Not looking for a free meal or anything, but as a business owner myself, I would think they would want to know about the problem, and get it rectified asap.  \n\nI like the food, but I won't likely be back.  Oh, and for the 9 people, the meal was just shy of a $1,000.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

The salad is one of the best salads I remember eating and could easily be enough for an appetizer.  The pasta tossed in a vodka sauce was just ok.  The homemade pasta is not actually made in house (I asked), but it is 'fresh,' which I'm assuming meant bought from a store on the strip or a market district.\n\nWe had also ordered the calamari and the meatball appetizer because we were starving and that proved to be way too much food for a family of 5.  If you must get an appetizer, I highly recommend the meatball, you will not regret.\n\nThe veal chop is easily the best thing on the menu and where Alla Famiglia really shines.  From all the pasta plates and steaks and seafood dishes that were ordered at our table, the veal chop was by the unanimous favorite at our table.  Incredible flavors and tender cuts, but by the time you get to the main course, you're full with the bread, salad, and pasta that comes before you can't really enjoy it fully.  Most plates come with a side of their grilled veggies (which again were ok), but some dishes come with nothing so I would make sure to ask if you need a side.   So long story short, this is a marathon and don't expect to be done in an hour and a half.  Pace so you can really enjoy that veal chop at the end!\n\nWhen you first walk in it seems very small, but there are back rooms and stairs that go up one or two floors.  There's also a back patio one floor up from ground floor.  It's tight sitting spaces, but very cute and authentically Italian.  \n\nSo now that we established that the ambiance and food are pretty solid, the thing that earned this 3 stars is how we were hosted to our table.  We had a reservation at 7:30pm and were 30minutes early, which we recognize is nowhere near to our reservation time so we elected to grab drinks and sit on the patio.  When 7:30 comes around we inquire about our table only to be told that there was not a sitting space yet, which would be ok minus the fact that there were multiple tables open that we asked about.  7:45 we asked again and were told that they were setting up a table immediately.  8:10 comes around and we're still not seated so had to ask the hostess again, which apologized and sat us at the table we had asked about 40 minutes ago when our reservation time was.  It took 40 minutes to seat us at our table for our reservation time of 7:30 when there were tables open.\n\nIt was a frustrating experience because everyone was hungry and we weren't even offered bread sitting on their patio...  The frustration unfortunately set the mood for the dinner and although our food was great, we didn't really enjoy the time we had here. \n\nWe really wanted to love Alla Famiglia.  Perhaps we'll try one more time and hope our experience is better.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

He started like he always does by laughing at our street name and having me spell it 5 times, then interrupted the order without excusing himself to set down the phone and yell at some children I heard in the background, then he argued with me about what the menu in my hand said, telling me I was wrong and it said something different.

When I walked in, everything was ready to go. Large portion of chicken was served in plastic and rice was in standard paper folder container. They were not stingy about duck sauce, soy sauce, and fortune cookies. #win #win\n\nJust like the reviews below, the General Tso's was just so-so. It definitely wasn't extra spicy but it did have a mild kick to it. To me, the sauce tasted a bit like wing sauce from a dive bar. I would get it again because it was good but it didn't have an oriental flavor to it. When ordering from a strip mall Chinese food place, I always expect each piece of General Tso's to be a quarter chicken and the rest fatty breading to which I dissect and just eat the meat.  My expectations were met but I wasn't disappointed because the chicken was good. \nThe meal had a decent amount of broccoli in it which was cooked perfectly for my taste, a little firmer. \n\nThe egg rolls were OK. Super crispy and not much filling...plenty of oil. They were free and so I can't really complain.  \n\nI will definitely eat here again. I'll probably try Sha Cha chicken because it's spicier or Kung Po. This place is good if you want cheap food that will hit a Chinese take-out craving. \n\nEveryone that worked there was really nice - Even the chef in the back said hello. That alone goes a long way in my opinion. \n\nSide note - It's the day after and I'm not sick so I give my seal of health approval.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LltDzuzRbAJbSrqD4JH-3A"}

Its a very \"come as you are\" sort of place and rightfully so as it's a tavern/restaurant but the staff may take the casual nature of the restaurant a little too seriously.\n\nOne evening about a year ago, I went in for dinner.  I originally thought to sit at a wooden booth in the bar and there was only 1 open, the last towards the back.  I sat down and the seat completely collapsed on me!  I'm far from what you'd call \"fat\" \"heavy set\" or even a \"big girl\" and the staff just sort of stared at me as though it were my fault that their booth just fell apart, the bartender even laughed at me while I tried to get up.  No one asked if I was ok, no one asked if I needed help and I was generally ignored as I tried to pull myself to my feet.\n\n*I* had to approach the hostess, tell her that the booth had just collapsed and ask to be reseated.  She rolled her eyes at me and told me the dining room was full so I'd have to wait.  \n\nOk, understandable... could you offer a drink or a manager or something while I waited considering the fact that your booth just broke apart?\n\nThe entire incident was either completely ignored by staff, like it never happened or I was looked at like it was my fault.  I didn't even get so much as an apology!\n\nI've been back a couple of times since then because the food is always good but I always sit in the dining room now which is sort of a shame because I actually like the bar atmosphere better.  \n\nLuckily for me though, their menu is online and they offer take out.  Unfortunately, they have the hostess answering those phone calls and since she's not a server, she doesn't have a lot of knowledge about the menu.  When I asked for a total, I was put on hold for a couple of minutes.  She finally came back and I asked how long and was put on hold again so she could go ask the kitchen.  She was quite rude about it, like I was bothering her.\n\nBottom line: Max's *is* the best place for German food in Pittsburgh, hands down.  But, the food is the only thing you're going for.

I have to say that she wasn't that impressed with the brew. \"Dirty pipes\" and I quote. I had the same taste from my order so I focused on the food.\n\nWe both ended up ordering Max's Goulash that was suggested by another Yelper! You can't go wrong when you have that recommendation. This is not our small town neighborhood goulash made from egg noodles and a mix with ground beef. The noodles in this feast were homemade and chunky, piled high with a peppery meaty sauce infused with fall off the fork beef, carrots, peas, and tiny pearl onions. If you remember yesterday was a cold, rainy, gloomy day. This was real comfort and I had to take it to go.

They were cozy, but the seats reminded me of old fashioned church pews. Our waitress soon brought us a little basket of four rolls with butter, sauerkraut relish, and apple butter. Though I liked the different varieties of bread, it was nothing special. The relish and apple butter were a nice touch though.\n\nOur waitress was busy with both waiting tables and tending the bar, but she managed to check on us pretty frequently. Our food also came out relatively promptly. I order the Wiener Schnitzel with Potato Pancakes and Spatzle on the side. The Wiener Schnitzel was amazing -- by far the best I've ever had! The veal was tender and the fried surface was perfectly crispy. However, the sides sadly did not match this main dish. The Potato Pancakes were oddly bitter, and I did not enjoy them with either the sour cream or applesauce. I only ate two or three bites and completely stopped eating them. (I must add that Hofbrauhaus's potato pancakes are delicious and something that I order every time that I go there.) I also did not enjoy the Spatzle, but I am accustomed to eating cheese Spatzle.... So I may be reviewing this harshly since I'm just not used to plain Spatzle, but in my opinion, it was terribly bland and watery.\n\nOverall, Max's Allegheny Tavern served one incredible item (Wiener Schnitzel), but everything else was merely mediocre.

It can admittedly be a little offputting to walk in if you're not expecting their seating arrangement, which consists of a mix of booths, regular tables and fold-up tables (along with chairs that you're more likely to find in a school than a diner). \n\nBut food wise, this is definitely the place to go for cheap, greasy diner eats. They make breakfast as well as lunch, and I have to say their breakfasts look pretty good (three egg omelets with a side dish? Holy crap!). I've mostly ordered their sandwiches and burgers and thought they were pretty good overall. As long as you come in expecting diner food and nothing else, I think you'll like what you find!\n\nA note - this place charges a fee for using a credit/debit card when you spend under $10, and their food is so cheap that you can spend less than $10 very easily.

I thought the meal was overall good though not anything spectacular and pricey for what it was - ~$18 ($17 for spaghetti and meatballs and $.99 for the greens and beans plus some tax). Maybe if they knocked a few bucks off to $13 or $14 or so it would be more reasonable imho. Also points are deducted for the corkage fee of $4 per person, not per bottle.

My wife and I stopped in this past week, and for me, I was reminded of why I enjoy Atria's...but this having been our first time at Atria's together, and witnessing my wife's experience, I realized why the place could garner such low reviews.\n\nFor someone like myself, who's actually had enough positive and negative food experiences at Atria's to know exactly what to order and what to steer clear of, I can make the experience a positive one, but that's a situation I'm afforded now thanks to my previous patience and convenience. My wife, opting to stray from my suggestions had an awful dinner. Her plate of bland fish and asparagus left her turned off completely. Luckily, we were using a gift card, so it wasn't as frustrating for her as it could've been. Regardless, walking away from an entire plate of food is disheartening.\n\nThat led me to realize this: If you're only at Atria's once, you're odds aren't that great of having a good experience. That's just the reality of the situation. There are a handful of really good things on the menu that I LOVE. The parmesan crusted chicken is really good, although it can sometimes be a little too oily. The pot roast is excellent, but it's way too heavy for most of the year...ESPECIALLY during baseball season when they're busier. Their chili is really on-point...especially paired with their bread, and the salmon salad is excellent. Although, I don't like the salmon, so I swap the salmon for chicken for a great salad option. The carrot cake is insanely good, but truth be told, it's not homemade. I could care less, though, as it's still some of the best carrot cake I've ever eaten. Period. Other notable items are the pot roast nachos, crab cakes, red skin smashed potatoes, and the reuben.\n\nThat's really where the positives end, though. I've learned to steer clear of the burgers because of the inconsistency with which they're prepared. I've received more undercooked burgers at Atria's than any other restaurant, and it's just not worth the gamble anymore. My filets have always been perfectly-prepared, but the one time I got a strip it was practically burned on one side and undercooked on the other. Failing to cook burgers and steaks correctly isn't that surprising, but deciding to serve them to customers despite their incorrect preparation IS surprising...and poor.\n\nI know that the last time I had salmon on my salad, the fish tasted \"off\" and I paid the price for it later. I've never given a single fish meal a chance there since (we're talking years now). Hence, my request for chicken on my salads now. Most of the meals that I've had are average, and I've practically tried the entirety of the menu over the years, so believe me when I say it.\n\nWhy do I continue to go? Well, because the few items that I do love, are crave-worthy, and having become a regular (less so, nowadays), the service that I received at the bar was always excellent. Daniel and Roy have always provided  great service to me, and good service goes the distance, as far I'm concerned, so it's been worth stopping in from time-to-time. Unfortunately, if I can't sit at the bar, I don't always stick around, as the service at the tables is really hit-or-miss. For every good server they have, they have two more that could care less about their jobs...especially during peak times.\n\nRegardless, this is my favorite Atria's location, because it's the least \"stuffy\" and pretentious location of them all, but there's still a lot of room to improve...and I hope it does.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Z101WZaISochG6g7tI2ZVw"}

Nice chunks of Pot Roast and various cheeses. I than decided on the Atria combo which had andouille sausage, Perogies, Chicken and Sauerkraut. I figured that this would be something different. The sausage was great and so were the perogies. I did not care for the chicken too much. It was dark meat with bread crumbs. I prefer white meat so that was probably the reason. I also tasted my friends steak  hoagie. I am from the area so I have had better. It was a little dry and not enough cheese and onions. The outdoors ambiance was great!

I visited this restaurant with a large group of about 40 people before going to a show at the New Hazlett Theater. We were seated upstairs and ate a buffet-style dinner (the dishes had already been picked). The two waiters who took care of us were extremely friendly and efficient, and they made sure we would leave in time for our show. While we waited for the food to come out, they served us drinks, but the waiter stopped offering straws after the first couple tables.\n\nWhen the food came out, they let a few tables help themselves at a time. They provided us with three different types of plates (large square ones, rectangular ones, and small circular ones), which I found odd. We had three entrees in the buffet line: Chicken Marsala, Tomato Vodka pasta, and Parmesan Crusted Tilapia.\n\nChicken Marsala: flavorful, tender chicken served with mashed potatoes. I really enjoyed the potatoes because they had a distinct potato flavor, unlike most butter-heavy ones. However, I wish they were more generous with the tomatoes and mushrooms in the dish. There was no vegetable-based dish in our entire meal, and I missed them.\n\nTomato Vodka pasta: penne cooked with just a little bite left in a yummy tomato sauce with a couple leaves of spinach here and there. Again, I wished there was a lot more spinach in the dish. Also, the pasta was a little sauce-heavy.\n\nParmesan Crusted Tilapia: the fish was crispy and delicious, the angelhair pasta was cooked perfectly, and the tomato sauce was good. I grabbed some pasta near the edge that hadn't been touched by sauce, so I liked the amount. No vegetables, though.\n\nAfterwards, they brought out a tray of bite-size desserts for us. I don't see any of them on their menu, so I'm not sure how the organization ordered them. Both the cheesecake flavors I tried (raspberry and almond) were delicious--the cheesecake was really light and airy, and the flavors really came through without being overly sweet or overpowering. They also had strawberry halves and chocolate chip cookies, which were soft and cakey--not the best I've ever had, but pretty good. Also, there were these little squares that, as far as I could tell, were squares of iced cake covered in chocolate. These were way too sweet for my taste. Mine looked like chocolate everything, but there were also white-chocolate covered squares, and other squares with different colors inside (different flavors of icing, perhaps?).\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the food, but I'd like to try a greater variety before giving four full stars (and see if there are any vegetable-heavy ones). However, this restaurant is a little too expensive for me to return any time soon. The service was great.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Z101WZaISochG6g7tI2ZVw"}

We were not brought or offered bread.  What brought down this rating was service problems which obviously were not the fault of our server.  I appreciated that the restaurant offered me a reservation when Open Table indicated that nothing was available on this day. The hostess did not seem to know how to handle a reservation and I do not believe that our arrival was matched to it. She asked another individual for assistance and I believe that person told her simply to seat us. After more than ten minutes had passed after we were seated without a server coming to the table, the hostess came over to ask if she could take a drink order.  She was not able to answer my question about whether the featured beers were draft or bottled.  Soon thereafter, our server, a charming and gracious young man, came to take the drink order.  We asked him to take our dinner order as well, given that this was stacking up to be a very lengthy meal.  More than fifteen minutes later, our entrees came, but no sign of my wife's wine and my beer.  I asked the young man who brought the food about our drinks and a few minutes later, our server came over, apologized, and told us how backed up the bar was.  He graciously told us that the drinks would be complimentary.  We received them more than five minutes after the arrival of our entrees.  These were not mixed drinks requiring anything special to dispense, simply beverages that had to be poured.  For almost the entire time we were there, a band was playing inside at a volume that was deafening.  We could not possibly have had our meal inside near the band as it would have been necessary to use sign language to converse and to order. We were seated outside as far away from the music as possible, yet it was still difficult to speak to each other over the din.  Additionally, the placement of the band in a small room makes it particularly difficult to snake in and out when coming in to use the restroom. The menu at this Atria's is a bit different from the traditional locations and some of the prices are not the same for items that are identical.

Simple. \n\nThere is no sense in overanalyzing what Mr. Wilson has been doing here for years.  He's not a competition circuit smoker, not a modern restaurateur spreading his seed across Pittsburgh, and certainly no hipster chef serving ingredients grown in his rooftop garden.\n\nRibs. Chicken. Sauce.\n\nThe slow smoked spare ribs, sold by the plate size or full rack, are smoked just long enough to make the rib bones protrude from the top of the slab but not long enough so the meat is \"falling off the bone\"... tender and juicy, but enough bite to let you know that you're eating the flesh off an animal.  The color and texture of the surface aren't overwhelming in flavor but give you just enough crust and seasoning to let you experience the strata of bark / meat / fat.  For those that don't like fat, you'll complain about the ribs.  Spares have a tendency to hold a bit more fat within the meat fibers, particularly the section around the tips that are usually trimmed for a St. Louis cut.  you want low fat? Eat a pork loin or a handful of grass.\n\nThe chickens are halved and smoked right alongside the ribs. The skin had nice chew, a good simple rub, and cooked beyond the point of any gummy texture but not so long that it was a layer of armor surrounding the meat.  The dark meat was succulent and the white meat maintained just the right amount of moisture.\n\nAs requested, everything was served with the hot BBQ sauce.  Not mind blowingly hot, but a well rounded picquant flavor with a bit of black pepper on the tip of the tongue.  Tomato base with a bit of vinegar, good enough to compliment the meat and fat of both animals.\n\nAs for sides, the collard greens are tender and you'll come across the occasional gold nugget of pork.  The coleslaw and macaroni salad are simple and a bit underseasoned, but when eaten in tandem with the meat and sauce they compliment everything just fine.  Mr. Wilson also caps off an order with the true stamp of great bbq... white bread. A vessel to mop up all the rib shrapnel swimming in the pool of sauce at the bottom of your styrofoam container.\n\nIt's not the cleanest, it's not the classiest... why?  It's a rib shack in an old house that's been here for going on 53 years.  It may not be the best barbecue you'll ever eat, but in a city with new restaurants popping up every week that all try to outduel each other with trendy ingredients, it's nice to know that I can walk in through an old screen door and be slapped in the face with a stiff breeze of smoking pork... without having to worry about anyone selling me small portion size, extravagant presentation, and a list of 35 ingredients to compose a single dish.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Z0OGW8PysysRXE0dR7QxQQ"}

My experience with Wiseguys is that their food is a GREAT meal for a GREAT price. Their salads A#1, their wings not too greasy, fatty, OR dry. To quote my friend Goldilocks,  these wings are JUST RIGHT. Now earlier in this review I spoke of stars. The star of Friday nights show was the cheese steak hoagie.

There is a long list of appetizers, tempuras and teriyaki dishes, and some Chinese offerings.  The main focus, the sushi, takes up a large portion of the menu, and there are many different rolls, ranging from the basic kappa rolls to the complex southside roll (shrimp, smoked eel, fish flakes, cucumber, spinach, mushrooms, egg and caviar).  As a vegetarian, I appreciate the vegetable sushi platter, which I have never seen anywhere else and only costs $12.  There is even a separate vegetarian menu.\n\nWhile I do appreciate the wide-ranging menu, I just can't like the atmosphere.  It's always very quiet and dark inside, and I always get the feeling of being in a cave.

And while I certainly didn't dislike my experience here overall I can't say I quite get what all the fuss is about.\n\nI came here for dinner and drinks with a friend and upon first entering we were pleased; the staff got us seats and our waitress very patiently helped us navigate their beer and cider options - which took a while, there were just so many! I truly do praise our waitress and the bar staff for taking my companion's final request, which was a little off-menu. No one complained and they whipped up my friend's drink while I went for a Pear Magner cider. \n\nThe particular night that we went was wing night, and while wings did sound wonderful we ultimately went for a plate of loaded fries in addition to our separate meals. It took a while to get them, but we figured it was getting busier since it was the evening and we let that slide. Here was where the meal began to lose some of its shine - while at first the fries were absolutely delicious, the more of them that I ate the less appetizing they tasted. I suspect that while the top layer was composed of perfectly cooked fries, the last layer of fries at the bottom of the plate was just drenched in extra grease and oil that kind of ruined the fries themselves for me. Plus, when ordering my sandwich I had asked for one of three sauce options listed on the menu - but once it arrived I realized after biting into it that my sandwich contained the wrong sauce. I didn't bother complaining at that point because of how busy it was - I didn't want to wait for a replacement meal; the sauce I got wasn't too bad or spicy for me, so the sandwich itself still tasted good, but it was still a bit frustrating. After actually finishing our meal, it took an INCREDIBLY long time for us to spot our waitress and flag her down for our check. We're not sure why she disappeared for so long; it was definitely odd to have our service go from above average to below average.\n\nAnd when we ducked into the bathroom on our way out? Good Lord, was that a tiny room! I almost hit someone with the door because you literally only have a foot or two between the door when it opens and the wall, so if anyone is standing on the other side they're often in the door's way by default. And it was almost impossible to sit in the stalls, they were so tiny. Definitely be careful when entering the bathrooms, folks.\n\nNeedless to say, my experience was pretty mixed - it definitely started out strong but it kind of went downhill throughout the night, although it never hit actual flat-out bad levels. I'd still come back to Cain's if someone wanted to, as their food was certainly enjoyable enough. It's absolutely a decent place with some decent options for food. It just wasn't incredibly impressive to me after all the hype I'd heard.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5Udv4CASAXB2eH66TefWPQ"}

This was my first visit and I was blown away by the extensive menu and attentive service.  I ordered the Shrimp and Strawberry salad - not something I would usually order at a bar.  But I was not disappointed! The shrimp were of a decent size and seasoned well. The salad was huge and at $12 was just right.  My guests ordered a variety of items including Buffalo Chicken dip (amazing); Spinach Artichoke Dip (great); and for their entrees - the Grilled Romaine salad topped with Filet; Surf and Turf ($14 - WHAT?); and a Steak and Egg something sandwich. Everyone seemed delighted with their respective meals and the drinks flowed all night long thanks to our wonderful server whose name I cannot recall.  \n\nUnfortunately, as the evening progressed the bouncer began his shift. Sigh.  I'm sorry, but he just wasn't nice. Not that bouncers need to be cuddly, but dang.  We were seated at the table closest to the door, a table which he clearly despises.  He rudely asked us (the two people seated in the outer seats) to move closer into the table when there was really nowhere for us to go; citing that patrons walking in couldn't do so with us sitting there. Lies.  There was plenty of room for anyone to walk anywhere.  He repeatedly got an attitude with one of our guests both vocally and with his body language; going so far as to seat his stool so close to our table that shoulders were touching. Get over yourself, dude.  I'll visit Cains again, but either won't go when there's a bouncer on duty (which is a ridiculous thing to have to do); or request a table away from the door and annoy the hostess.

What I heard was true after dining here- food is really good, service leaves a lot to be desired. Two of us were the first to arrive for a party of six. We waited a good 10 minutes at the \"please wait to be seated sign\". No one even acknowledged us standing there until two other members of our party finally arrived. They were semi busy but cleared out quickly since it was a 4:25 steelers game and several tables there looked like they were heading to the game. Anyways, a server came over about 5 minutes after we were sat. To get our drink order. She was pretty slow getting our drinks out to us. The other two members of our party arrived by then and when she came back she said the kitchen was running 30 minutes behind and we should order appetizers now if we wanted any. Ok so we ordered 6 old bay wings, 12 thai chili wings, and 2 orders of the cheese sticks. The cheese sticks were the best cheese sticks I have ever eaten! They are huge-3 to an order but these are so thick and gooey....and the marinara served with them is a sweeter marinara, it's very good. I didn't try the old bay wings but they were quickly devoured by the rest of the table. The Thai chili wings had a very nice sweeter flavor. And they were large wings too. Very tasty. She came to take our food order prior to our appetizers coming out. They did take awhile but she did warn us they were slow. Entrees came out quickly however. I had ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. It had a horseradish BBQ sauce that sounded really interesting. The server came over halfway through the appetizers and said they ran out of the pulled pork. I was disappointed but I ordered a turkey Rachael with sweet potato waffle fries instead. The sandwich came on marble rye with coleslaw Swiss and thousand island. The fries weren't great and we're kind of soggy. The sandwich though was excellent. Real rotisserie turkey and lots of cold slaw which is how I like it. A steak and egg hoagie was ordered with chips-she said it was really good and it was huge portion wise. Another ordered the pastrami sandwich and another ordered the pastrami salmon blt. Both were said to be tasty. The quesadilla burger and the bacon and blue cheese burger were also ordered and were quickly eaten and said to be delicious . 4 of us took home half of our sandwiches - portions are huge! Our server didn't check on us and it was us who had to flag he down for drinks. This is a great place to watch a game, lots of beers on tap, good food. Service needs to improve but I wll still come back again because the actual meal was tasty and priced right", "type": "review", "business_id": "5Udv4CASAXB2eH66TefWPQ"}

I had 2 eggs over medium, their in-house ham from the bone, Texas toast and potato pancakes which came with my choice of applesauce or sour cream (I got sour cream). The eggs were cooked perfectly, and the ham was nice-- just salty enough. The potato pancakes were different than what I expected.

Instead of going to our standby, the Original Pancake house, I suggested we try the Dor-Stop. We arrived at 12:30 and were soon joined by the 3rd person in our party. The hostess informed us that we were next on the list for a table and would be seated soon. I was surprised at how busy it was on a holiday. This small little diner was packed with people. Every table was full as well as every seat at the counter. About ten minutes later, a waitress came over and called two parties that arrived after us. My husband had to go talk to her and explain how we were waiting longer. She apologized for skipping us and was able to seat us right away. Once seated, I had a difficult time deciding what to order from the extensive menu. Wow! They have a huge selection. \n\nI finally decided on the special, Apple Harvest French toast with bacon. When I asked the waitress about the special, she had a difficult time describing it but I still wanted to give it a try. Once we ordered, it took well over 15 minutes for our food. I understand that they were very busy but that amount of time did seem a bit excessive for diner food. When my french toast arrived, it was not exactly what I was expecting per the description but, it was very tasty. The french toast had a nice crisp on it and the cream cheese sauce had a lot of flavor. However, for being APPLE harvest french toast, it was certainly lacking apples or apple flavoring. This french toast would have been perfect with slices of cooked apples on top instead of the small apple pieces that were mixed in with the cream cheese. The bacon also lacked a nice crispiness. \n\nI also had the opportunity to try my husband's banana chocolate chip pancakes. Although they looked delicious with the bananas and chocolate chips baked into the pancakes, they tasted rather salty. My husband agreed with my assessment. It seemed like the cook was a little heavy handed when adding salt to the batter. Overall, I wasn't overly impressed though, I would give the Dor Stop a second chance based on their huge selection to choose from.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}

I went on a weekday morning so that I could actually get a seat and have the food at it's prime--not cooked in a hurry to see how the food really was.  Well, that was also the only time I had, as well.\n\nI was greeted quickly and seated and given a nice cup of coffee.  They did an exceptional job of keeping the coffee mugs full (another reason  to go on a weekday) and it was good coffee.  \n\nI had to try the hot cakes, but didn't want to OD on carbohydrates so I got the Egg Combo with the speciality hotcakes.  The waitress recommended the banana oatmeal or the apple cinnamon.  I went with the banana oatmeal.  Two over easy eggs and bacon, though they offer sausage patties or links in both regular (sage) and hot.\n\nMy food came quickly and I was disappointed to find the eggs sharing the plate with the hotcakes.  I like my food separated and dippy eggs leave a residue that sometimes can't be mopped up with bacon.  I guess I would have preferred a plate with the eggs/bacon and a plate with the hotcakes.  \n\nThe eggs were cooked perfectly as was the bacon.  Crispy yet chewy.  I have to eat my eggs and bacon before I can eat my hotcakes, because, again, I don't like my food touching--especially something sweet and savory.  \n\nLet's talk about the hotcakes.  They were served with a big dollop of whipped butter which I loved.  Whipped butter spreads pretty easy.  I like that.  I'm picky.  Especially with breakfast.  There were slices of banana cooked in which I also liked.  They tasted like a diabetics worst/best nightmare.  They were sweet and fork tender like a nice pancake should be.  They would have been fine without syrup.  When I added syrup it felt like I was eating a slightly sweeter version of banana bread.  I wanted to stop at one.  I really did.  I really really did.  I was getting full.  I can stop eating food that isn't good without much of a problem.  I had a problem with that second hotcake\n\nMy other \"complaint\" is that is is rather expensive for a small diner.  I paid a little over $10 for my breakfast.  For $10, I would have preferred a more generous portion of bacon, at least.  My idea of pricing is a bit off, I guess, mainly because I live in an area outside of Pittsburgh that is a lot less expensive.  \n\nSo, I will go back, for sure.  The breakfast is GOOD and I think most places that attempt to serve breakfast should be GOOD.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}

As a standard on the menu, they have many flavors to choose from: pumpkin, banana, blueberry, choco chip, raspberry, etc. I ordered the special of the day: chocolate cherry cheesecake pancakes. They were pretty good! I liked that there were actual cherry pieces in the filling- I appreciate real fruit being used in my breakfasts. If u like a pancake that holds up against the weight of toppings and syrup, while maintaining a soft spongey texture, you will like these. I hate when pancakes get immediately soggy- these do not! \n\nThe boyfriend ordered Bob's specialty, as it is not a standard breakfast item either- eggs with German potato pancakes, applesauce, and sour cream- it did not disappoint! The potato pancakes were a tad on the sweet side, but I liked them. \n\nAnother great thing here is the down-home feel of the place- everyone is very friendly.

But at 8pm I was ready to eat anything and Bado's was on the way home. So I parked and walked I'm and the place was packed. Good sign. So a seat at the bar opened and the Pens were playing. So I ordered a bottled IPA and read over the menu. I needed to power carb after a long day of sitting in a hospital waiting room. The bartender who doubled as a pizza chef told me the white pizza was exceptional, so I took his advice and ordered a medium, figuring I could have it for lunch the next day. What arrived was this wonderfully thick, cheesy, reeking of garlic in a good way, just what I needed, comfort food that instantly made the days worries seem distant. The first bite was heaven, chewy center, crisp bottom, olive oil coating my mouth, ooey, gooey italian cheeses, saltiness from the black olives I ordered as a topping. This was pizza! Two slices and I was full, I drank my beer and paid the bill, and walked out with lunch and dinner for the next day. I must return here someday and have the same pie.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qemCNgjeYGcFsRwxW9x4xw"}

Lebo and asked if my wife and I wanted to meet for dinner. We said sure, and they chose Bado's.\nThe place is nice with a warm, inviting atmosphere. \nOur server was friendly, but clearly dealing with to my tables. He actually made me feel anxious when he'd stop by!\nMy family decided to split a traditional pizza with pepperoni and mushroom. My wife and I added a dozen Guinness/ Honey Mustard wings and split a Reuben.\n\nThe wings came out in record time and were pretty good. Although, I still don't think the Guinness aspect did anything for the flavor. They sure tasted like any other honey mustard wing I've ever had.\n\nThe Reuben was average, but very large. It came with potato chips and a pickle spear. For the $9 price tag, you'd think they could do fries over chips.\n\nThe pizza was good; not great. Based on reviews, I thought the pizza would be even better. Maybe I'm being a bit picky, but there are enough great pizza joints in the city that you can afford to be.\n\nAll in all, Bado's is a nice place to have a casual dinner. I wouldn't go out of my way to try it, but if you're local give it a go. If you want an inviting atmosphere where you can enjoy a beer, have some pizza and enjoy the company of friends or family, this won't disappoint.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qemCNgjeYGcFsRwxW9x4xw"}

We waited 12 minutes to get refills and when she did pick our cups up she grabbed them from the inside, (her under nails were black by the way).

I want around seven on a Monday night, also Columbus Day if that has any impact, and there was really no crowd.  My server, Barry, was very nice and was very good.\n\nRight off the bat, I'll explain why am taking two stars away. The service was a little bit too fast for me between my two courses as within maybe three minutes of my salad being taken away my pizza came right out. Normally I'm a fan of fast service but that was a little bit too fast for me. I'm also taking a star off, and whoever reads this review will probably think this is a stupid reason but this review is my opinion, because the salads with the exception of a few or overpriced compared to the other appetizers.\n\nI had the grilled portobello mushroom salad and the 4 cut margherita pizza. \n\nThe salad was huge but great, the house Italian dressing complemented the salad really well. The salad was a nice mix of mushroom and greens, though I'd have preferred a bigger helping of greens. Of course you're not going to like this salad if you don't like mushrooms. \n\nThe pizza was tasty and pretty well done. Oh my goodness was it tasty. You could really taste the tomatoes and basil playing off each other and neither was overpowered by the cheese. Secondly, the tomatoes tasted fresh, not like the canned, heavily processed kind or tomato paste but like the diced San Marzanno organic tomatoes you can buy at fancier grocery stores. That went a long way for me with the pizza. \n\nThe con for the pizza: I have to say it was weird to me that the crust was this weird mix of crispy and kind of hard to cut and then perfectly chewy. The actual bottom of the pizza was crispy, like it should be so the pizza doesn't fall apart, but it was a little too crispy for my tastes as there were a couple points where I had a hard time cutting the pizza into bite-size pieces. I also have to comment that two of my slices, the two that I ended up bringing home because I was stuffed, hadn't been fully cut apart and that was a little annoying. I can overlook it, but it's still something I want to comment on.\n\n\nThis isn't the kind of pizza that you can easily just pick up and eat with your hands because there is so much to it. It's a very dense pizza. \n\nI want to end this review by commenting on the slightly weird pricing for the pizzas. The pizza is priced based off of how many slices the pizza is cut into. And, I feel the pizza was a little bit pricey for the four slice pizza that I got, it was just under $13. \n\nThat all said though I had a fun time at Bado's and I'll go back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qemCNgjeYGcFsRwxW9x4xw"}

This weekend I had burgers on the brain! My BF and I got the Balboa, the BBQ Texas, and two dogs, mac n' cheese and Mason Dixon with with cheese.\n\nThe burgers had really delish toppings but the meat was so dry. It was overcooked and did not have one bit of juicyness dripping down my hand. Missing that major component they were truly lackluster. The macaroni dog wasn't that great either. Mac n' cheese should be creamy, salty, buttery. So sorry but this weenie came up flat too. I did like the Mason Dixon! The crunchy-ness of the coleslaw made a huge difference but the meat was still chewy and too salty. Could it be that I am too picky when it comes to my meat?

The restaurant itself has a cozy feel to it, and their large beer cave is one of the few places where I can get some of my favorite import beer.  Note, the Czechs make more than just Pilsner Urquell. Je to pravda! Most of the staff are very friendly, and the managers are always quick to help if you need assistance.  \n\nSome of you may get angry with me, but I simply cannot review D's I without comparatively rating it against its sister restaurant, D's II in Monroeville.  And no, I couldn't possibly care less that the latter is in an old Pizza Hut.  That's right, I prefer D's II to D's I. Hear me out.  \n\nFirst of all, D's I' drafts are all about a dollar more expensive than those in the suburbs.  Why the upcharge? \n\nAlso, after being spoiled by the very large menu selection at D's II, I'm always a little disappointed when dining at Regent Square.  No wraps, no steak salad, no variety of sandwiches.  I will say that the food they do serve is good.  I enjoy their pizza and their daily hummus offering.  \n\nD's I has a much smaller draft selection and lacks a full bar.  Fine.  It's a smaller location and it stays true to its original \"beer bar\" theme.  Sometimes, however, I like to mix it up.  And I can do that more easily at the Monroeville location.  Obviously, I's beer cave trumps II's beer... um... outcove? \n\nSo all of that warrants a four-star rating.  Why the three? Like its suburban counterpart, I'm docking a star for closing so early.  Even when there is a crowd, the staff closes at 11:00 (Su-W) or 12:00 (Th-Sat) on the DOT.  That's just not responding to demand!\n\nOverall, I don't dislike D's I.  Quite the contrary.

But from the moment my friend and I walked in on a Friday at lunch time, we were kind of bummed.  We sat down at the bar, and the bartender refused to even acknowledge us, let alone serve us.  So we switched to the other side of the space.\n\nThe service on the other side was better but a tad slow.  I started with the macaroni and cheese ($3.00).  It was just doctored Kraft mac and cheese, with a bit too much salt, but for the price is was reasonable and good.  I ordered a Chicago dog ($5.50), and the hot dog was an all star for the most part.  It was an authentic Chicago style dog, and the toppings were fantastic.  My friend ordered a Big Ben hot dog, and it was pretty gross.  The cheese picked up the vinegar-y taste from the coleslaw, and it made the cheese taste sour.  Not appetizing at all.  \n\nD's grills their hot dogs, which is normally fine.  However, both my friend and my dogs came out very burnt.  One of hers was literally inedible, and these hot dogs are pricey.  The server did not say anything about the practically untouched hot dog and just took it off of the table.\n\nThey do have some daily or lunch specials for cheaper hot dogs so check that out.\n\nThe verdict?  I would come back here for a Chicago dog and ask them to boil it to prevent the risk of a singed dog, and I would return for the beer cave.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g"}

How large your portions.  How nostalgic you are.\n\nWe were the proud owners of a gift card to Applebee's (Christmas gift!) and the best part of this gift was my boyfriend's reaction to me later.  He has never been to an Applebee's.  Or an Olive Garden.  Or a Chili's.  His first time at a Red Lobster was with me when we were stuck in a strip mall hell for the night.  So he's new to these restaurants, which so many of us grew up with.  I'd only been to an Applebee's a handful of times, but I was down to go back - it seems like they sort of have everything, no matter what you're hungry for.\n\nSince we're spending all our time now packing to move back to Chicago (WOOHOO!), we don't always have time to make dinner.  So we busted out the Applebee's gift card and journeyed to Edgewood Towne Center for some chain restaurant foods.  \n\nWhen we arrived, this server really awkwardly asked us to sit at the bar.  I missed the finer points of the interaction, since he was talking to my boyfriend, but he basically insinuated that he'd just sat some large tables, or something, and it was his turn to have a table in his section but he didn't have the time to serve us, or something, and he didn't want us to wait (for what, I'm not sure) so he was basically like \"Can you sit at the bar?\"  Which was weird because there were like, at least a dozen open tables.   But whatevs.  The cool kids sit at the bar, and we are the cool kids.\n\nChuck, the bartender, was running this show.  Dude.  He was on top of everything.  Taking orders, serving drinks, answering phones, getting takeout orders, keeping his bar neat and tidy - he was HOPPING!  We were both in awe just watching him.  That man is earning his tips, for reals.  So I'd recommend sitting at the bar if Chuck is working.  He's also cute, so bonus there.  The Applebee's bar is kind of a hilarious place - random people having drinks as if it's a real bar and not a restaurant, this one lady READING A BOOK WITH A GLASS OF WINE like it was some fancy cafe, some annoying fratty people....and us.  A healthy mix.\n\nI had a Shock Top and my boyfriend had a Sam Adams - mad props for Shock Top on draft, not expecting that from Applebee's.  We ordered spinach and artichoke dip, which I believe was half price (as are all apps) during happy hour.  It was served with regular tortilla chips (like from a bag) but the dip itself was pretty tasty.  It was served in a really wide but shallow crock, and tasted appropriately spinachy and cheesy.  It was served very hot and was pretty satisfying!\n\nMy side salad arrived shortly thereafter, and it was amusingly huge for a side.  Iceberg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, crispy croutons, shredded cheese, tangy bottled Italian dressing on the side.  I bought it to balance out my entree, but somehow these iceberg lettuce salads never really feel healthy, you know? Like eating crispy water.  With cheese and croutons.  YAY HEALTH!\n\nThen came the entrees - I got an order of wings (which I think is technically listed as an appetizer) with \"Sweet and Spicy Sauce\" which was listed as the second-hottest sauce on the menu.  They were pretty decent - served hot, juicy chicken, and the sauce was sweet and sticky.  It was a little *too* sweet for me - picture gloopy Chinese takeout in sweet sticky sauce, and that's what the wing sauce was like - but it still made a satisfying meal.  My boyfriend got one of their \"special burgers\" from their new New Orleans menu -something like a Bourbon Bacon burger.  They asked him \"pink or no pink\" which we thought was funny.  He said \"pink,\" and the burger came out with like, a tiny touch of maybe-pink in the middle.  Medium-rare, this ain't!  He said it was okay.  Not great.  Just a burger.  I didn't taste it, I just nibble on a few of his fries, which were pretty average.\n\nThat all came in at around $30, aided greatly by the happy hour appetizer discount.  I have no interest in going to Applebee's again because I can get better burgers, pasta, chicken, bar food, everything, etc anywhere else, but if I was road tripping and needed a place to stop, this wouldn't be a bad choice.  Sit at the bar and hope Chuck is there, and enjoy pretty average versions of American bar food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "h3la53L9-OX_HlfeAySh0Q"}

Sooo... if you're a fan of Teppanyaki, this review may ring familiar. If you've not done Teppan style before... consider this a sort of \"what to look for\" primer.\n\nThere were five of us, sharing our table with a very nice young, near-newlywed couple; May 2010. Our table wait time, without a reservation, was about 35 minutes or so. (maybe they were waiting for a newlywed couple to join us?). And what lengthened the wait was the understaffed bar. We waited nearly 10 minutes to see a bar-server, and another 15 minutes to get our drink order. While everyone was friendly and apologetic, even apologies get old when they're used to salve away exceedingly slow service. Maybe the reason they appear to be busy, even on a Wednesday night.......? They had an abundance of tables celebrating \"Birthdays.\" I'd guess I listened to at least twelve renditions of \"Happy Birthday\", sung by the \"Greentree-Benihana-Bday Choir!\" (Oi vay...... next time I'm bringing earplugs!)   :-))\n\nMy impression? This is Pittsburgh; not my destination for \"great Japanese cuisine.\" So while this fine city certainly has some excellent eateries, when it comes to chain or franchised restaurants, you have to compare each location to the balance of their nation-wide organization. And having eaten at Teppan style restaurants for many years, and many Benihanas, I'd have to grade this particular location in the \"C\" range; very average.\n\nBefore we were seated, and while we were waiting in the bar, I spied the dining room. It appeared all the chefs were slow, seemingly ackward with their knives. And almost comically so. One Anglo chef, (no offense to Scandinavians that dream of becoming a Teppan-Guru), well, this guy looked like it was his first night, cutting off the shrimp tails...... almost one at a time, and still having a problem!? I think you get the idea. I've seen some Teppan-knife wielders, line up the shrimp and with one long swipe... de-tail-a-fy 30 with one stroke! Not here... some of the chefs may be on \"beginner knife-speed restriction?\"\n\nAs one reviewer mentioned; \"...it depends on which chef you get at your table.\" And with Teppanyaki style restaurants, and especially Benihanas, it's very true. It shouldn't be like that, but here in Greentree, and the evening we went, (Wednesday night around 630p), it was like going to a \"Barber College\" to get a free haircut, and trying to figure out how to judge the best out of a group of \"beginners.\" Our chef was possibly the best of the crowd, (sounds like... \"You have to go to my doctor, he's the best!\"), but if compared to all the Benihanas I've visited, he too would be a C to C- level; maybe a \"brown belt\" in marshall arts vernacular? He did the \"flip shrimp tail into the hat and pocket trick\"..... finally making it on the third try. But he did smile throughout the demo. (A good attitude is worth allot in my book.)\n\nThe food? Pretty good. Essentially, we ordered \"everything on the right side of the menu\"... mainly because I was treating my customer service staff... the greatest asset I have for my sales region. And because one of them had never Teppanyak-eed, I made sure we tried everything! Sushi, lobster, filet steak, scallops, shrimp, calamari, chicken..... well, you get the idea. What with the added rice and vegetables, it was a \"belly-busting-feast.\" And again, because of the great company, we had a wonderful time.\n\nSo overall, I gave this restaurant 3-stars. It was the total experience. The food was good, and more important, the company was great. But as you can see from my comments, I felt like this particular Benihanas location was struggling to meet the corporate concept; trying to do it with Pittsburgh locals who, from the hosts to the bartending staff, to the chef and server staff, just seemed like misfits. Had this been a \"Lone Star Steakhouse\", or a \"Fridays\", I'd have felt everything fitted just right.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1vQLTKwmcmZXtNzfKEvMmA"}

The food is always very good though and I have never been disappointed by it! The green tea ice cream is especially unique and delicious! I also love their buttery lobster and would definitely order it again!

Our waitress showed up 2 seconds later to take drink orders and appetizer/sushi orders. I just asked for water and some time to actually look at the menu. several min later out waitress came back with drinks and asked to take orders. I ordered chicken and steak along with a cranberry mojito. Quickly after taking orders our waitress brought out our soup. I liked it but it lacked salt. Before I even finished the salad course came out. I was able to enjoy both before the chef came out to prepare our meal. What did bother me was all the dishes in our area. I can't stand a dirty table and I wish our waitress would have removed them sooner. Our chef Penny wasn't the best hibachi chef I've seen but she was great with my son and he really enjoyed watching her. She was honestly a lot of fun. The hibachi itself was pretty good. I liked the fried rice which is an up charge. The steak was good and so was the chicken. I honestly don't think it was anything special. Dessert was ice cream also nothing special. \n\nSo to sum it up our waitress seemed overwhelmed and managed to make me feel rushed even though I feel she could have visited our table a few more times then she did.

The furnishings, carpet, set up hasn't changed in years and the staff/food isn't always up to par. I can eat Paleo here though, which was a new discovery. I've always appreciated sushi, but I never ordered it raw without the fun additions of tempura, sesame seeds, soy sauce, cream cheese, and everything else that makes sushi AWESOME, so this was a new experience. I ordered the Tuna Tatiki, which was 10 chunks of raw tuna. I ordered it without sauce or seeds. It was a little tough to get down because there were so many pieces and after a couple raw pieces, I needed some extra searing, which they did for me no problem! The server was wonderful- she was helpful and had no problem going to extra mile for someone with diet restrictions! I was very happy about this because the last time we sat in the bar, our waiter was really odd. He didn't explain the foods and extra charges (our waiter last night did) and he seemed like we were bothering him. I was happy to have a better experience last night, but I do think that Benihana needs to monitor their staff better. I had negative experiences twice related to incompetent staff, which really made my overall feeling of Benihana go from positive to neutral. Not to mention, the last time I was there, perhaps because we got hibachi at the bar, but it was not very good at all, and I got the most expensive dinner on the menu: \"Ocean's Treasure.\" More recently when I visited Benihana though (the same time I got the raw tuna), I had a better experience- I ordered salmon and yellowtail sashimi. I was very nervous to bite into a raw cut of fish by itself, but was pleasantly surprised at how good the cuts of fish were. The yellowtail had a sweeter taste and the salmon was less sweet, but more flavorful. It was a great to jump outside of my comfort zone and appreciate the rawest of the raw food! I would definitely recommend Benihana due to its location- I love that it is on a hill all to itself, and it's unique mark in Pittsburgh, but I would choose other hibachi restaurants before I would choose this one.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1vQLTKwmcmZXtNzfKEvMmA"}

Honestly, the only time I have ever been to Benihana has been for birthdays. As many yelpers noted- their parking lot is VERY odd. Be prepared.\n\nI wanted to try some items that I never had at Benihana before, so I decided I would be adventurous and try some sushi....vegetable sushi that is (I am not a seafood lover). The vegetable roll consisted of: green leaf, avocado, cucumber, tomato, red cabbage and yamagobo. I dipped it in some soy sauce and added a small dab of wasabi to each bite. I didn't love it- I think sushi just all around is not something that I enjoy the taste of. \n\nFor my meal, I ordered the hibachi chicken. My boyfriend ordered the spicy hibachi chicken. The first course was soup. It was a light, chicken broth based mushroom and green onion soup and it was decent, nothing crazy or packed with flavor. The salad came shortly after- ice berg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced radishes and ginger dressing. I loved the dressing! I wasn't a fan of the mediocre choice of greens and vegetables though. \n\nThe main portion of the Benihana/hibachi experience, is the show. Our chef was very nice and very talented. He recognized the birthday girl at our table and gave her a special chef's hat, haha. He prepared our vegetables, shrimp appetizer and main entrees in front of us. The vegetables consisted of zucchini and onions. I agree with other yelpers- the vegetables could be improved. The portion isn't very large and more variety could be added. Having said that, they were delicious. The shrimp was also very tasty. \n\nMy entire table ordered the fried rice with their meal and I HIGHLY recommend doing so, rather than ordering the white rice. The fried rice is made fresh right in front of you and is very good! The yum-yum sauce, of course, is the icing on the cake... SO GOOD. It went perfectly with the rice, chicken, veggies and shrimp. My whole table asked for additional sauce to go and the staff was very friendly and super accommodating! The hibachi chicken was very good and came with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. I really enjoyed my boyfriend's spicy hibachi chicken- the sauce was wonderful.  \n\nAt the end of the meal, everyone had a choice of sorbet. I had the rainbow sorbet- it was the perfect ending to a delicious meal. The staff also took our picture and printed a copy for the birthday girl.\n\nBenihana is not my favorite place to eat at all, but they are a great place to go for a birthday. The staff was wonderful, the food was good and we all had a great time. Oh and a side note- their Shirley temple's are awesome!", "type": "review", "business_id": "1vQLTKwmcmZXtNzfKEvMmA"}

The enchiladas remind me more of chilaquiles - definitely more layered than rolled.  The burritos are huge but it really drives me crazy how segmented they are.  One bite will be all rice, the next will be all meat.  The tofu tacos are okay, but the bean sprouts seem like a weird addition.\n\nI know, you're probably thinking \"What DOES this girl like about Mad Mex?\"  If you can let go of any previous Mexican food experiences (or if you've never had Mexican food before, as I hadn't when I first went to Mad Mex), some things are ok.  The tofu tacos minus the bean sprouts.  The California grilled salad.  The chickpea chili and black bean soup, the potato taquitos.  Nachos, chips & salsa, and guacamole are all decent.  Their sides are ridiculously huge and the desserts are all ok (except the sopapillas).  Basically, stick to the least authentic stuff and you should be fine.\n\nAdditionally, some of their entrees are available with your choice of either chicken, steak, shrimp, portobello mushrooms or tofu.  They have tons of vegetarian options.  They have good happy hour deals and good late night margarita deals.  They have raspberry, strawberry, mango, and kiwi margaritas year round, with one or two seasonal flavors per month, plus a full bar, a bunch of tequilas and a huge, varied beer list that tends to focus on local beers.\n\nSo basically: the less you know about Mexican food, the less disappointed you will be.  If you're a fan of authentic Mexican food, either stick to something more basic like a salad, or pick a different restaurant.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hhNlQWaKqGbMPoeZHoL-IQ"}

Don't upcharge on the salami then hide it under the cheese so I can't see how may pieces you actually placed on the pizza. The pepperoni was about the size of breakfast sausage and tasted ok. The price, as others have mentioned, is high for a pizza and salad.  The wait staff were friendly and on the day we went the place was very busy with a party upstairs.

If it were just based on drinks/service/viewing, I would give it a 4 or 5 stars rating. The food drags it down a bit.\n\nI've been to SoHo about 20 times (as I frequently stay in the hotel above it), and they have a decent beer selection and a very good/knowledgable bar staff. The bar can get extremely packed on game days, as it is literally across the street from PNC Park (and a short walk from Heinz Field). On an off-night, though, it usually has a moderate crowd that trends toward the 30-something \"hip\" groups (it's not a college bar, nor a neighborhood pub).\n\nAs far as food, it's really hit-and-miss. Once I had Buffalo Chicken Pierogis, and they were awesome. I've also had a Tuna Steak Sandwich there that was great (if I remember correctly, it had some sort of chipotle or wasabi mustard on it that was yummy). However, as I ate there last night, I saw the lower end of the spectrum. I had a shrimp/scallops pasta dish (Diablo Pasta?), and it was not spicy at all (despite being advertised as such). It was just OK (the ingredients, other than the sauce, were pretty good, but the sauce was just passable). A friend of mine said that the French Onion soup was awful (way too much oregano, he said), and his \"sirloin\" sandwich was not sirloin. So I would just say it's either inconsistent, it has gone downhill, or there are just a few things that they do well.\n\nThe service, however, is fantastic. No matter how busy they are, the staff is very attentive and friendly (I've never had to wait long for a beer). I've also had quite a few drinks, over my visits, \"on the house\", which doesn't happen very often anywhere else. They also know a bunch of bartending \"tricks\" that they will do on request (like the Bailey's/Yager \"switching shot glasses\" one).\n\nOne last note is that it is usually pretty smoky in there, so be prepared to have your clothes reek after you leave (which, sadly, is the norm for Pittsburgh).\n\nBottom line: as a bar, 4.5-5 stars... as a restaurant, 3 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FtjvnLhh51ZBYEpKAARaFQ"}

Catherine was hungry--she said she could have eaten cardboard at that moment and it still would have tasted good! \n\nLuckily, she didn't have to go that route and the food here was much better than cardboard! \n\nWe began our lunch by splitting an order of Angry Shrimp. Angry Shrimp is very spicy (as its name implies) and is served over chilled pasta. For my main course, the Apple Raspberry Salad sure was tempting, but my blood sugars were running high (I'm a type-1 diabetic) and I already had my carbs with the pasta. I wanted a burger as a second choice, but their burgers are 1/2 pound and I knew I couldn't finish one. Plus I didn't want to schlep leftovers on the bus. So I opted for a Chicken Cobb Wrap, which was tasty enough. \n\nFor the life of me, I can't remember what Catherine ordered, but she did remark that the food was good. She tried the Penn Pilsner beer, which she loved. I don't drink, but unsweetened brewed ice tea with a little lemon in it really hit the spot. \n\nSo the food here is good as is the service. But there doesn't seem to be anything that distinguishes this place from Chili's, Houlihan's, Mex & Erma's, etc. And I wish they'd offer 1/4 lb burgers.

I go here about 6 or 7 times a year.  The bar itself is beautiful.  The seating is great with a huge circular bar in the middle and a lot of leather seats towards the sidewalk by the open air doors and windows.  They also have seating outside which is good for people watching especially when there is some type of event in the city.  I've found the staff to be a little above average, but nothing special.  By far the best thing about this place is the space itself and its location in the city.  The drinks are pretty good, but overpriced.  Some martinis are about $10, which is fine for a stellar top shelf martini in Pittsburgh or an average martini in NYC.  This is not a stellar Pittsburgh martini.   I believe that any bar whether its in your basement or at the \"French Laundry\" should have guinness on tap (just my personal belief), and this place at least has guinness but serves it out of a can.  Another annoying thing is depending on who serves me I pay a different price.  Last night I paid $7 for a guinness (which is way too much) and then minutes later I ordered another one from a different bartender and paid $5.25.  The food is two stars at best and very inconsistent.  They bill themselves as a \"tapas\" place, but it is obvious to me they don't understand what \"tapas\" entail.  Go to ibiza on the s. side for your tapas.  Some of their selections are better than others.  I've had the quail before which was seasoned well and cooked perfectly.  Last night I tried the AHI tuna which was of good quality, but could have used some wasabi or a stronger flavored sauce to compliment the good quality tuna.  I also tried the lobster cakes.  The lobster was barely noticable and the cakes had way too much breading.  The best thing about the plate was the curry sauce on the side.  I'd have to say that the location and space of the restaurant is 4 stars, but the food is 2 stars at best.  Another weird thing is that I've been here before on more than one occassion when they simply said they were not serving food (and it was like 8 on a Friday).

I usually go to the bars on the North Shore prior to Pirates game, but this was a lot less crowded and good for the group I was with.  In fact, truth be told the place was only about 1/2 full (on Bucs opening day!?).  The food was okay.  I tried these nachos which were good and interesting because it had a decent quality sausage as the meat and not just ground beef.  I also really liked the sweet potato fries.  They were delicious and you usually can't get these at too many places.  I ordered the lobster roll.  It was a ton of lobster, however some of the lobster was a little overcooked and it was ice cold.  I can understand serving cool even though Id prefer warm, but ice cold really wasn't that good when they put warm butter on it.  I also tried the tortilla soup, which was really rich and had a good spicy flavor.  The only thing missing in the tortilla soup was the tortilla chips.  A minor oversight I imagine.  Overall, a pretty decent place when you are looking to just have a few beers with friends.  I've also tried the upstairs bar which is the more upscale section.  The bar is huge which is good plenty of room, and their is plenty of seating including leather couches.  The happy hour is okay, but it's pretty much a ghosttown after 8 PM.  Overall a decent place for quiet drinks without the crowds and a little better than average food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OxIeMVcop5oxBUWANi-1Rw"}

A friend was at a wedding upstairs and asked us to drop in to say hi. Apparently they host wedding receptions in the lounge area above the bar/restaurant.\n I was hoping to get a quick meal and a drink before the show. When we arrived the bar was packed and we were told that they had no availability to sit in the restaurant section. But, little can deter me. I scoped out the tables by the bar and noticed a couple getting ready to pay. After making casual chit chat, they agreed to save their table for us. They paid and left while we ordered a drink at the bar. As soon as they got up the waitress put a reserved sign on the table, I assumed it was for us and sat down. Nope. She was trying to reserve it for an 8pm reservation. I thought this was the bar area which is seat yourself? Oh well, I told her we had to be out by 8 for a show anyway so it would work out fine. A few minutes later she came back and told us no, that won't work and we will have to find a place at the bar. Seriously? We are already sitting in the seat yourself tables, it was fine 2 minutes ago, we have to leave by 8, what's the issue? Rather annoyed we looked for seats and ways to inch ourselves into the already overly crowded bar when the waitress returned and said she will reserve another table that was leaving. Now, we have wasted 10 minutes of our already limited time before the show so, I asked what was the fastest thing on the menu. We ordered soup, salad and the buffalo chicken spread. The soup arrived first. I had the homemade chicken noodle. Warm, comfort food that hit the spot. Next was the pear salad with candied walnuts, blue cheese and strawberry vinagerette.  Again, super tasty. I could snack on the candied walnuts all day. Then the buffalo chicken spread. Presentation was great-in a martini glass. The pita chips were delic! But where was the chicken? I searched through the entire martini glass, not one shred or chunk of chicken. Being a buffalo chicken dip lover, I was sorely disappointed.

There weren't any signs or notes anywhere about happy hour specials, so I asked our bartender. I cannot remember everything that she stated, but I zoned in when she mentioned $2 off Martinis. I chose the cucumber basil martini and my friend did the same. Too strong for me- even with the basil infused vodka and fresh cucumber, my friend on the other hand found it light and refreshing. \n\nWe weren't that hungry so we decided to split an appetizer and order salads. We split the chicken quesadilla appetizer and both ordered house salads. I modified my house salad to have feta rather than blue cheese and chose the strawberry vinaigrette as my dressing. \n\nThe quesadillas were good, as far as chicken quesadillas go. The guacamole it was served with was awesome, although they didn't supply us with enough salsa, sour cream or guacamole for all four quesadillas. Or maybe I am just too obsessed with condiments, haha. \n\nThe salad was yummy , I loved the vinaigrette! It was a decent portion as well. \n\nAlthough I enjoyed the experience, I do not think I will be returning. Two drinks, two salads and one appetizer cost is $50.

It's a bit chopped up but very Pittsburghese reminiscent of most establishments.  There is the upstairs where you can sit by the roaring fire on the 72\" flat screen or lounge on many of the couches or loveseats they have available.  There is also the downstairs that seems to have similar offerings, however at least in our experiences was a lot busier than upstairs.  I pick less busy almost every time.

I know they specialize in Martinis but I specialize in craft beer.  After that I decided to try a martini, I went with an Espresso Manhattan Martini.  This was defreakinlishious... I love coffee and I love manhattans so the two went together like peas and carrots.  Our service was mixed.  Some bartenders seemed more helpful and interested in waiting on us than others.  This was also my experience from last time.  This time we didn't order food though we were pretty hungry and went elsewhere to eat.  Our last meal here was not worth duplicating.  We both had an Olive or Twist Burger, and I chose sweet potato fries and requested a med rare cook.  We used the Yelp deal so it wasn't as expensive as it could have been, but the burger sells for $13.00.  I rarely complain about cost especially if it is good, however it really was not.  The meat was way overcooked and dry.  Surprisingly the fries were the best thing on the plate.  To spend that on a burger I do expect a better quality.

As the name suggests, they are known for their martinis.  With about 2 dozen on the menu, it was hard to choose which one to get, but I went with el jardin and then the dark knight.  Both were delicious (and actually my first two martinis).  We all passed around our martinis and each one was better than the last.\n\nFor food, we started with the nachos and calamari.  The nachos were nothing to write home about (pun intended), but the calamari was more than just fried.  It had a sweet glaze on it that tasted almost like maple syrup, but not that sweet.  Really delicious and an interesting take on an appetizer that is usually just fried and served.\n\nFor the entr\u00e9e, I got the delmonico steak.  It was tasty, but not hot when it was served.  In fact, my grandfather got the same thing and he asked them to heat his up and it came back exactly the same.  The server was very polite and made it clear that he told the chef to heat it up, but i don't how on earth a chef can get that feedback and send out the same exact thing.  After a second time of asking to heat it up, it finally was hot when served.\n\nAll in all it was an interesting restaurant and definitely a good place for a drink or two if your downtown in the area.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OxIeMVcop5oxBUWANi-1Rw"}

I could probably go with out having the fries on my actually sandwich as well. Apparently, that's there big move; they put the fries and cole slaw on your sandwich. I was also a little bummed about the fries; they end up getting really greasy and soggy. I'm a fries \"well-done\" kind of guy so this didn't really impress me from a flavor or texture standpoint. In the end, it didn't add to the flavor of the sandwich for me; it actually made it a big soggy mess.\n\nThe portions are enormous and the price is right for lunch. Well under what I think they could charge for the amount of food they give you. \n\nFor those Pittsburgh-ians who travel to the Los Angeles area, let me recommend Langers (look it up).

I got the Colossal Fish and Cheese sandwich.  The beer batter fish was a very large piece and by itself was not bad tasting at all (just a little under seasoned.)  The fries were limp and had no seasoning what so ever. The fries were the worse part of the sandwich.  The coleslaw was  very mild, sweet and vinegar base, and by itself it was ok, but put everything together between two slices of white bread and it made for a bland pile of flavorless starch.  The bread was also too soft and did not hold up well at all, and the cheese was nonexistent.  I ended up having to add a ton of salt, pepper and malt vinegar to my sandwich, picked it apart and ate the pieces with my fingers.\n\nPrice:  For the size of the portions you get, the price is great!  I got two sandwiches and a soda for about $16.  Their sandwiches range from around $6 - $8 each, and are a good value since you will definitely leave full (I took home left overs.)\n\nAtmosphere:  After reading a few reviews about the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this place was not packed with tourist.  For being such a small dinner, the place was fairly empty so I was able to sit anywhere I liked (being a solo traveler, restaurants often try to stick me at the bar but I prefer to sit at a table.)  The tables were clean and organized well, and each table had a stack of paper menus to look at.  It felt like a comfy, good ol' local dinner where you can casually relax and eat.\n\nStaff:  During my visit, the staff was great!  There was only one waitress and one cook, but both were pleasant and greeted me as soon as I walked in.  The waitress was attentive and friendly.  The cook also thanked me for patronizing there while I was leaving.\n\nOver all, I basically came here just to say that I visited a famous Pittsburgh restaurant, but I most likely will not go there again.  If I was with friends or family who wanted to go to Primanti's I would go along, but I wouldn't go solo.  The blandness of the food is what kills it for me.

Sounded good and I was in town so I thought I'd give it a shot! I went around 4 pm on a Saturday and it was pretty busy! Usually a good sign. There were only about 3 people in front of me in the takeout line, so it shouldn't have taken long for me to place an order, right? Wrong. It took maybe 15-20 minutes for those 3 orders to be taken because nobody would commit themselves to working the register. While waiting in line, I got to see all these mouthwatering sandwiches being made. Once I placed my order, it didn't take long to come out...\n\nSo I got a Pittsburgh cheese steak, their #2 most popular item (don't ask what their #1 is...the guy will roll his eyes and unenthusiastically say, \"beer.\") Long story short, what I ended up with was a bland, lukewarm beef party with bland soggy fries on top. The cold lettuce and tomato cooled the sandwich even more. I enjoyed the coleslaw on top, which is pretty much all I ended up eating from the sandwich. And a few limp fries.

Frankly they take these ready-made empanadas and microwave them before serving them to the customer, so i don't understand why they coudln't have just gotten some more from the huge mound of empanadas i saw in the store just minutes before. but i was too lazy to ask. also, they microwave the empanadas on styrofoam plates....no comment.\n\nthe 1 taco for $3/ 2 tacos for $5 was probably the best deal that I could find in pittsburgh for some close to authentic mexican tacos as i coudl find.  They indeed pack your taco with a lot of the fixings, but in doing so, they don't realize that all the juicyness that comes from the meat (especially the lengua) causes the little corn tortilla to rip very easily.  i have not been any other mexican joint that serves these style tacos with only one little corn tortilla: they're always made with two corn tortillas with the presumed purpose of protecting rippage.  one star off for that.  The salsa on the side that was left out that was the perfect consistency of the type of salsa i like (non chunky) was somehow too dry.  this may have been due to lack of freshness.  if only it were fresher, it would have been a nice complement to my tacos. on the upside, they prepare the meat from scratch, putting a little blot of uncooked meat on their grill, while they prepare it in front of your eyes. that was a welcome difference for this joint compared to other taco joints.\n\nall in all, compared to the other place in pittsburgh i've tried for tacos (Mexico City), I'd much rather come here.  closer, cheaper, and tastier. mexico city does not do mexican food justice.", "type": "review", "business_id": "buVALudg30kgkDusqB3yJw"}

I have been going to Rolands since I turned 21 a decade ago.   The beer selection is one of the best in Pittsburgh if not the best.  And, I agree with Jason P. in that the best sandwich in the burgh is the lobster roll.  I prefer the cold lobster roll as opposed to the hot, but they are both awesome.  It's a very generous portion of lobster on a garlic bread roll.  They have a very good raw bar with oysters, shrimp, crab and other goodies.  The outdoor seating is awesome.  Sit upstairs and look at the passerby's on the street at the strip.  Saturday's and Sunday's afternoon are the best time to visit.  The pizza is also pretty good, brick oven and thin crust.  The seafood stew is a great deal for about $15 you get a delicious broth and lots of fish and shellfish.  The bartenders are great.  It's pretty well known that John the Irish guy is the best bartender in the burgh', however I think he only works one day a week now.  Bo is very good and my buddy Jeff is also a good tender.   They have pool tables and darts, so plenty of bar games.  The only reason I don't give this place four stars is that they don't have all the top shelf liquor that my heart desires.  They have new management since my buddy Rick went to Bettis bar.  And, they are lacking in some liquor selections since.  They don't have patron or any top shelf rum.  I ordered a top shelf long island iced tea yesterday and was disappointed to taste cuervo instead of petrone.   However, overall the place is a good time and a must visit in Pittsburgh.

We were a party of 12. Even though the restaurant was busy, they were able to get us a table. Apparently there is a second floor room that can be rented out for parties, but they don't take reservations. \n\nThe interior of the building is nicer than I thought, judging from the outside and other Yelp reviews. They have a lot of large televisions, which would make this an ideal spot for watching a game. \n\nOur server was very pleasant and friendly, but some of the staff has that native Pittsburgher gruffness, which some people might translate as rude. There do seem to be some staffing problems, though. A latecomer to our group asked another waitress clearing a nearby table if she was our waitress. The woman said \"no\" and walked away without offering to get our server. It was a little weird. Our waitress also had people at the other end of the table yell their lunch orders, even though it was very loud. She could have easily walked over, so that was odd, too. \n\nNot being in the mood for fish, I ordered the white pizza. It was very large, much bigger than I expected. I ended up taking the leftovers with me, and it fed me for two more meals. So, while the prices are a little more than you'd expect to pay at a similar restaurant, many of the portions are huge. Two people could easily split the fish sandwich.\n\n The pizza was pretty good, with a paper-thin crust and plenty of tomatoes and pungent garlic. I think the garlic was from a jar. The cheese was a tangy blend. \n\nAll of Roland's pizzas are oven-fired, and some of my pieces of crust were burned black. This may be a plus to some people, but I don't much care for it. \n\nIn all, it was a decent meal, and the rest of my party seemed to be happy with their food.

Too bad, the other elements were great. \n\nMy mother said she'd had the lobster roll at Roland's a few years ago and she had the exact same experience. \n\nSo c'mon Roland's...you're in the Strip...figure out a way to make that lobster roll PERFECTION.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wHi8ODv7TGmeUB02XoX-mA"}

Like so fricken hungry we ordered a ton of food lol. So we got the calamari and it was the worst calamari, maybe even the worst seafood, I have ever had. Now, being a seafood place you would think this wouldn't happen. It was sooooo over cooked that it tasted like a rubber band. Then I got a side salad and my husband got a bowl of clam chowder. Salad was great, fresh and the peppercorn dressing was extremely tasty. My husbands chowder....the best soup I have ever had! It was creamy and had a ton of clams in it. I mean it, the best clam chowder by far I have ever had! So at this point we were confused. So I got an Italian style pizza with spicy sausage which, I have to say wasn't bad. The sausage had a kick and it was a crispy crust. The sauce lacked a little, prob just tomatoes. My husband got their famous hot lobster roll and, just like everything else, was enormous and it was pretty good. Roll was buttery and the lobster was cooked well. \n\nThe service wasn't bad, just extremely slow. So I really was confused by this place so the only thing I knew what to was to give it 3 stars bc I have no idea if I would come back or not? Maybe the calamari was a mistake? I just don't know. I would come back for the soup for sure...but for a seafood place to mess up fried calamari as an appetizer...come on!", "type": "review", "business_id": "wHi8ODv7TGmeUB02XoX-mA"}

We found seats at the bar and a friendly bartender greeted us and took our drink order.  The drafts arrived right away and we requested menu's...  \n\nWe ordered 2 shrimp cocktails and a calamari.  The shrimp arrived within 5 minutes and came with a small bowl of cocktail sauce with a dollop of horseradish on top.  I mixed mine as I love horseradish but my friend would have preferred it on the side or in another bowl as he isn't a fan.  The shrimp were big and fresh and delicious.  I mean- can you really mess up cold shrimp...?  The calamari took over a half hour to arrive.  It was pleasing to the eye and smelled delicious.  It had grilled onions & peppers on it with a slight spice dusted on top.  I thought it was delicious but my wife wasn't digging it.  She thought it was overcooked & rubbery.  Our friend isn't a fan of calamari so we didn't have a 3rd opinion to be the deciding factor...\n\nThen things went south...\nMy wife went into the ladies room and came out with a straight up disgusted look on her face.  I saw her stop a waitress and after the 'chat' the waitress turned away and rolled her eyes.  Well, my wife said the bathroom was disgusting- Toilet paper & paper towels all over the floor, 5 stalls with only a half roll of toilet paper to be shared between all 5, no paper towels to dry your hands off after you washed them.  Does the employees have a separate washroom to use or do they use this one also and just don't notice???  The health dept signs say \"Employees must wash & dry hands with soap & hot water\".  Then I visited the Men's room and found almost the same thing- paper all over the floor in the stalls, I didn't notice if they had tp in there, and no paper towels to dry your hands with.  \n\nTo us- the bathrooms must be clean & well stocked or we wonder what the kitchen & other 'back of house' areas look like.  If the bathrooms are in this much need of attention- the kitchen must be worse...  \n\nWe paid our tab and left...", "type": "review", "business_id": "wHi8ODv7TGmeUB02XoX-mA"}

The first thing to note that surprised me a bit is that Salonika doesn't provide table service--orders and payment are accepted up front, and food is provided on trays that you take to a table in the dining area.  The staff bus the tables, which clearly needed doing at the time of my visit.\n\nBased on other Yelpers' recommendations, I ordered the rosemary half chicken with lemon potatoes ($7.39), and CM did the same.  While the flavor of this entree was decent, I found it extremely greasy, and I suspect the chicken wasn't of the best quality, since pieces of bone kept breaking off and ending up in my mouth.  As for the lemon potatoes, again, the flavor was on point, but the texture was off, such that they were mushy in some places and so hard as to prevent chewing in others. The sauce on the plate from the potatoes had a great flavor, which I used to dip the chicken and complimentary pita bread that came with the entrees into, but it was also quite greasy from the chicken.\n\nCM and I also decided to order dessert, with him ordering the baklava and me ordering the chocolate cake, which looked super-tempting in the case.  I'm happy to report that the cake didn't disappoint--it was substantial and moist with thick, fudgy icing and a pleasant, though unexpected, tinge of anise flavor.  I tried a piece of CM's baklava, and enjoyed it as well--it had a generous coating of honey, and plenty of chopped nuts.\n\nOverall, I found the food at Salonika to be inexpensive (at least, for entrees and the Cultural District) and flavorful, but to be lacking somewhat in execution.  I'd consider returning the next time I'm downtown and have a craving for Greek food, since I believe Salonika is one of the few gyro places downtown that stays open beyond lunch hours.  If I'm looking for a nicer sit-down dinner, however, I'll pass Salonika up for one of the many other restaurants in the vicinity. 3.5 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WXpi9z1bqF9raZSW8z70Ow"}

The two waitresses and the two behind the counter doing the cooking seem to be having a good time.\n\nMy slice of pizza came and it looked so yummy. The crust was perfectly done and it had cheese artfully oozing over the pepperoni. Esthetically beautiful. Unfortunately when I bit into it, the taste was just average. It wasn't bad, the crust held up just fine but the sauce was lacking \"oomph\"... that zest that you look for when eating pizza (at least it's what I look for). \n\nDon't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad slice of pizza, just average. Average in taste, average in size, even average in temperature. I wouldn't go out of my way for a slice of pizza here. But I wouldn't put up a fuss if I was with a group and they wanted to go. But I'd probably opt for one of their tasty sandwiches or maybe try one of the pasta dishes over the pizza.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DhDNNHZtaBxYNSqJz64ixg"}

I was curious as to how it would compare to the other nearby slice shop, Cafe Milano, which left me underwhelmed.  Ultimately, my assessment of La Gondola ended up being similar, but at least the owner was friendly and didn't aggressively upsell me.\n\nTo get an idea of what their pizza is like, I ordered two slices--one of the thick crust Sicilian, and one of the thin crust regular ($2.50 each, I believe).  Additionally, I ordered a small side salad ($3.50).  The salad, while not anything too special, was enjoyable, esp. given the price--I especially enjoyed the generous topping of pizza cheese.  As for the slices, I could tell they were made fresh, based on the amount of time that they took to come out and seeing the owner ladling sauce on them before they went into the oven.  I have to agree with Chip's assessment here--they struck me as fairly average in quality.  While there was nothing wrong with them, per se, they just weren't very memorable.  I can't speak for the toppings, since both of my slices were plain (the thought of ordering a topping occurred to me too late), but a good pizza stands on its own.  While I guess $2.50 is relatively inexpensive downtown (esp. in Market Square, where the rent must be sky high), it's more than I'm used to paying for slices.\n\nOn a positive note, the owner was very friendly, as I mentioned--there's always something to be said for service with a smile.  On the flip side, however, the furniture is looking pretty run down, with large visible tears in the upholstery, and could definitely use an overhaul.  Overall, not bad, but also probably not good enough to make me seek it out again, given the competitive downtown dining scene.  3.5 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DhDNNHZtaBxYNSqJz64ixg"}

A half dozen times she came by and said it'll just be a few more minutes.

Katie K., her sister, and I were wandering around downtown Pittsburgh on a Sunday night and many other things were closed. We stopped briefly to look at the menu that was laid on a table outside, and a nice old man came right out and invited us in. So we followed him.\n\nIt's a cramped little space, made even more so by the insane amount of Greek relics/touristy items everywhere. Even on a Sunday night, though, the place had a good and varied crowd ranging from teens to families to old men hanging around.\n\nOur waiter, who I found out later was the owner, was odd in a fantastic way. He just was bright and quick, and obviously loved his lot in life.\n\nWe started with the Hummus ($4) which came with fresh, hot pita bread. The bread was great, but I didn't enjoy the hummus (too bland). We each had a glass of the house wine (red and white) (~$3?) which were delicious. I ordered the Lamb Kebab ($12.95) which came with some grilled veggies and rice pilaf on the plate but also included a soup/salad. I loved the soup. LOVED it. It was a milky broth with rice. Sounds odd, but perfect for me as I was getting over a cold, and went well with the pita bread from before. The grilled veggies were good, and I really liked the rice pilaf. The lamb kebab was not bad, but Katie K's was so tough she didn't eat much of it. I did not have the same problem, though we'd order the chicken next time.\n\nWe finished the night with Baklava ($3) and the famous Onassis Dessert ($3). The owner regaled the entire place with the story of how he worked on the Jackie O yacht for years and this was her favorite dessert. Goodness, I can understand why. It looks like a simple slice of vanilla cake but it's so much more, with a honey syrup and whipped cream with cinnamon. I want it. I want it now.\n\nOverall, it was a 3-star kind of place. Good but not great. The dessert and wine were top notch, but it lost points on the main entree and the price (which I thought would be reasonable but topped out at $25 a person with tip!).

Then, lo, and behold, Monica, I'm assuming one of the restaurant owners, walked up to us on the sidewalk menu in hand convincing us to come try her restaurant just a few strides away. And convincing she was.  \"Why not?\" we both thought.  She did such a good job giving us a sales pitch, we thought her restaurant deserved a chance tonight.  \n\nWe were ushered inside the small venue to a table very near another couple just finishing dessert and asked about their experience.  The fact that they were happy being there and the fact that there were other patrons was a positive start.  I was so afraid we were going to be ushered into an empty place begging for business but, not so.  There was a steady stream of clientele, most due to Monica's steady persuasion, I'm sure.  \n\nWe started with hummus and pita and a glass each of Greek white and red wine.  Then we ordered lamb and chicken kabob combo and some other greek dishes which came with a decent salad and a side.  Finally, we had to order dessert, knowing full well it would be home made.  The guests nearest us had ordered the Jackie O (as in Onasis) cake and another pastry, which is what Monica recommended to us so that's what we ordered.  It was all pretty good, not stellar, but pretty darned good.  I've definitely had more flavorful kabobs but I did appreciate the family home cooking aspect.   The wine was ok but would rather have ordered off a wine list.  The salad was a nice size and was good.  The Jackie O cake was light and moist -- a hit.  \n\nOne point to know that has been mentioned in other reviews:  the main meal looks to be inexpensive but it will add up quickly.  Everytime Monica looks at you with smiling eyes and asks if you'd like some wine, then ask if you want another glass, or do you want some hummus, and finally if you'd like dessert, you really want to say \"yes\" as if you're at your favorite aunt's house.  But, of course, each of these items comes with a price which you're glad to pay at the end of the meal because of your gracious host's manners and offerings.\n\nI swear that Monica has the best work ethic I've seen in a long time.  From the moment she saw us on the sidewalk, she was in motion from ushering us in, to seating us, to taking our order, to presenting our order, to refilling our water, to cleaning tables next to us, to flagging down more clientele, to making sure we and other clients were satisfied with their meals, to taking our payment.  \n\nOne small humorous note as other reviewers have pointed out:  Ask for directions to the restroom and you'll be ushered through the kitchen, saying hello to the dishwasher and the cook, down the stairs.  I've never experienced that before (probably for good reasons).  But, it was humorous.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PxP19Rb88OQKiSMl2oWNsg"}

Now that we know our way around a bit more, decided to revisit.\n\nThis time, no one greeted us upon entering.  There was one other table of diners.  There was a gentleman in the back at the cash register along with a girl and a boy who barely looked old enough to work here.  They might have been family members but I don't know.  No one seemed interested in greeting us at the front of the restaurant so my husband walks back to ask if they are open.  They are.  Finally, the young male leads us to our table with menus.  \n\nWe decide on the baklava sundaes.  They were reasonably priced -- 3.00 each -- and decently flavored.\n\nI just want to say the experience was quite a bit different than the first visit.  The first visit had us excited to try the restaurant, as the woman who worked there (I'm assuming one of the owners) was eager to pull us in from the sidewalk and entice us with her menu offerings.  This time no one was excited to have us as diners and they seemed to wish we weren't there.  Quite a difference in personalities and style.

Here is what I recommend: rice needs to be better prepared and perhaps have some nuts, raisins or garnish added to it, the lamb could be thicker, have the fat and/or tough parts removed and also have a stronger marinade or come with a gravy or sauce for more flavor, and maybe the mashed caviar could be mixed in with some unmashed caviar, which would give it much more flare and appeal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PxP19Rb88OQKiSMl2oWNsg"}

The huge restaurant brought back waves of memories as soon as I entered.  We were seated in the trolley room (although not in the trolley).  \n\nService was decent, but the server had a friend sitting at a nearby table, so there were times she got caught up in conversation and seemed to forget she had a job to do.  I ordered the spaghetti with a seafood sauce and was highly disappointed.  The shrimp were tiny and tasteless and the sauce very salty and unappetizing.  It was very clear this was a frozen and thawed dish rather than something that was freshly prepared.  The server had steered me towards it (and away from the spaghetti with mushrooms), so when I mentioned it, she brought me a whole new dinner.  That was a nice touch because they certainly didn't have to do that.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my trip down memory lane and the food was decent, but I don't think I'll return again unless I have a coupon or I'm bringing a child to enjoy the trolley or bed rooms.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9mwShpTgZofOujt4JfyGmw"}

I remembered the experience being pretty underwhelming, so I didn't have high expectations, but we had ordered food for delivery last winter (no, they don't deliver, but one of the online delivery services had them listed), and the food was good enough that we figured it would be a decent meal...and it didn't disappoint on a food level!\n\nNow, I'll never claim that Spaghetti Warehouse is the best Italian food spot in the city, but the prices were very reasonable for the portions you get, and the food is actually pretty good. We tried the classic bruschetta as an app. It was really good, and while you \"only\" get four small pieces, it was a perfect amount for the two of us. The endless salad and bread is a great touch for those who are fans of the Spaghetti Warehouse's counterpart, The Olive Garden. \n\nMaybe it was the plaque for the 8,800 lb. World Largest Lasagna on the outside of the restaurant, or the photos in the menu, but I couldn't resist trying the 15-layer lasagna. I actually got the lasagna & chicken park combo, which was probably enough to feed two, despite my gluttonous ability to eat it all myself. The lasagna was good, with a very sausage-dominant flavor, which pleased me. I think my only complaint would've been the lack of sauce. There was barely enough. Same complaint goes for the chicken parm that was on the plate. It was good, but definitely could've used a little more sauce. I'd likely request extra next time to be safe. The bread is awesome, but disappears too quickly! Overall, there really wasn't anything to complain about regarding the meal itself. We went in with chain restaurant expectations and weren't disappointed. When we had ordered food for delivery, I tried the eggplant parm, which was really good. My wife said the wedding soup was also awesome. I'd say two positive food experiences out of two is a good trend!\n\nThe biggest issue that I have with Spaghetti Warehouse - and the reason I can't give it more than 3 stars - is this: while the expectations/food quality are in line with what you'd expect from an Olive Garden and the vibe is what you'd expect from an old school TGI Friday's, the reality is that the restaurant itself in in shambles when you compare it to those two (or any other chain, small or large, in the same category). For a restaurant that seems to always be packed, you'd think there would be money to maintain the inside of the restaurant a little. We sat in the bar, and the fans above the bar were in various levels of disrepair. The TV's at the bar were all so old that you'd never choose Spaghetti Warehouse for a place to grab a meal if you were hoping to also catch the game. A small tube TV/VCR combo? Even the dive bars that we hangout in are more up-to-date! The cleanliness left a lot to be desired, as well. In a dive bar, diner, or truck stop, I'd be okay with the griminess, but in a large restaurant? No thanks. I'm not saying it'll keep me away, and it clearly doesn't bother the masses that keep the lines flowing out the door, but it really needs to improve to make Spaghetti Warehouse a destination that I'd be quick to recommend.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9mwShpTgZofOujt4JfyGmw"}

They make delicious breakfast sandwiches and frittatas. \n\nIt is safe to say that all the small plates and sides are excellent at Buon Giorno, while the main entrees are only so-so.  For a cafe that is only open for breakfast and lunch downtown, that's really all you need.

Also its in a fish market so there is an overpowering smell of fish at all times\n\nThe next downfall is the overall cleanliness.

Ten years ago, I ate here sometimes twice a day.  Over the past year or two, it has gone downhill.  And now?  Well, I hope they read their reviews, but I doubt it.  It would not take much to correct what has gone downhill, but I have seen negative reviews for awhile, but I kept coming back, because I was a regular, maybe I got better food.\n\nFirst...  I like Korean, because I like the ban-chan.  These are the side dishes you get with any Korean meal.  You used to get seven dishes, and they were good, well seasoned, always great.  Then it went to five, now it is down to three or four.  I asked the waiter if this was really all they had.  I tip well, the waiter knows this, and was apologetic that, yes, they only had four type of ban-chan.  And not the \"good\" kind.  You used to get slices of the Korean pancake, or sweet potatoes, not to mention excellent kimchi.  Bean sprouts, and broccoli yum!  Now, you pretty much get kimchi, the sweet red beans, bean sprouts.  That is it.\n\nSecond...  The portion size of the meat was way down.  And I mean miniscule.  Hey, if they are having trouble paying the reant because they expanded out of all proportion to the actual number of paying customers they have, that is not my issue.  Unless they start shorting me on the size of my portion.  In which case, I vote with my feet.  I am not eating here again, period, until I see a turnaround in the negative reviews.  And if I suddenly see a bunch of reviews that sound \"planted', well, that is not too hard to figure out.\n\nThird...  Their sushi has gotton way overpriced and the pieces of fish have gotten really small.\n\nSo, I am done with the place.  I will probably stop by in a few months.  But right now, that Pho place down the street is way better than this.  Not to mention the sushi I can get at that one Asian market that is just a little further up on the strip.  Too bad.  I LOVE dol-sut-bi-bim-barp, and this place used to nail it.  I am not a small ticket customer either.  Just for me, my standard order was a bottle or two of soju, dol-sut-bi-bim-barp, or the grilled korean short ribs, a few pieces of salmon sushi, and then whatever the wife wanted.  And I would tip 20%.  Way to save cash dude!\n\nedit - 12 June 2011...\n\nI have eaten here about three times since I wrote the above review.  I still do not get sushi here, but the side dishes have taken a turn for the better.  Still not enough different ones, but better than it was.  And the food has gotten a little better.  I still have not really pigged out at the weekend meat buffet.  And it is on my list of \"things I REALLY want to do\", will write it up when I do it.  problem is, for what they charge, and how little the wife eats, not worth it.

I did have some of the korean food and was very underwhelmed.

The chicken was really tasty, but the rest of the selection was a bit bleh. As one of my friends put it, the bulgolgi from Trader Joe's is better than what we had here.\n\nIf you go, be nice to your tablemates and try to rotate the cooking duties. It's really lots of fun to go with friends and to have a communal experience, so even though I'm not sounding like I had a great time, the reality is that we all had a lot of fun and enjoyed ourselves. But don't go thinking that you are going to have the culinary experience of your life.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dHDi4wCcjsOR6vcZ8oOIoA"}

I was willing to look past it after seeing plenty of other seafood items on their menu, and we settled on a cup of the Redfin Bisque each  and decided to split a large shrimp and crab pizza.\n\nThe Redfin Bisque was absolutely delicious... my only gripe is that it's a VERY small portion for the $6 price tag.  For that price, I expected a large bowl of soup, but instead it's just a small cup that I downed in about 2 minutes.  The flavor was great, it was the perfect temperature, but the portion size for the price might make me hesitant to order it again next time. \n\nThe seafood pizza came out shortly after and it smelled heavenly.  Even the waitress commented on how good it looked.  We ordered the large pizza but probably could've gotten away with the smaller size, since we ended up taking about half of it home.  The portion of the crust that wasn't covered in toppings was yummy and cooked well, but the crust underneath the toppings and olive oil sauce was a bit too thin and soggy - definitely couldn't eat the pizza without a fork and knife.  The quantity and quality of toppings was great for the price and the flavors were great, I just wish the crust had been a little more consistent throughout the whole pie.\n\nOverall this is a nice place to grab an outdoor bite along one of our three rivers, but I wouldn't necessarily say it's somewhere I will go out of my way to visit.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41CXLCeB8z2oNdIOvnrzIA"}

The portions were large and the prices were very reasonable. I ordered the Virginia Spots with crab meat and broccoli and loved it! The house salad and balsamic vinegarette were very tasty...I would eat salads more often if I had that dressing at home. We ordered the zucchini fritti and the waitress was nice enough to warn us that the portions were huge and recommended a half order. My boyfriend ordered the crab cakes and green beans, he liked his meal too...I didn't try them but his green beans came with roasted red peppers and they looked so good! \nThe bad: I always order a vodka and cranberry when I go to restaurants, and I've never had any automatically assume I wanted top shelf (grey goose)...they've either asked what kind of vodka or given me the standard, so my drink almost cost as much as my meal. Not the biggest deal though.  I enjoyed my drinks.  The big downfall was the parking. The restaurant said that they validated the parking garage under the building, and the hostess gave us a ticket for the parking garage as soon as we walked in.  No explanation with it, so we assumed it was pretty straight forward, put it in the machine and go.  However, when we were leaving and put the ticket in the machine, it wouldn't accept it, so the attendant came over to help us.  We explained our situation, and he said we owed $15? If we had to pay any additional fees, one would think that either the restaurant or the ticket would have said so.  My boyfriend only had a $20, and the attendant didn't have any change of course so we paid $20 to park in that garage. One of the selling points of that restaurant when friends told us about it was that they validate parking. Had I known that was going to happen, we would have parked at one of the cheaper garages around the block.  Something to keep in mind for next time, I do still think that I will be returning.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gfpl_GyyY5uj6zJnIdzImQ"}

The Villa holds a soft spot in his heart as well due to the many many post work nights he spent here slugging beers and eating pizza with friends. \n\nFast forward 13 years and now I am the one working downtown, slugging beers and eating post work pizza. Unfortunately though, Villa Reale has become so expensive that treating it as a weekly stop is a bit unreasonable.

On another occasion my dad requested to come here as his payment for helping me move.

The dogs are grilled and they do have a certain \"crunch\" to them.  I like the all-beef dog  with mustard, onions, relish, pickle, and (thanks to my Chicago friends) NO KETCHUP!  The chili dogs here are fantastic too.  \n\nThe place is kind of spartan, but it's really more of a \"grab-n-go\" place.  I took mine back to the office.  They also have a walk-up window and in the summer, many people prefer to dine \"al-fresco\".  There are numerous squares and plazas nearby in which to have a pleasant lunch.\n\nI heard a great quote once about work and it went something like this:  \"Probing the minds of management around here is like probing the innards of a hotdog.

I had first sampled the famous about five years ago and hadn't had one since.  Now, that I've moved the office downtown it's convenient for me to visit as much as I'd like.  Ray, Tom and I found ourselves wondering around the city around lunchtime trying to get a lay of the land and find the good lunch spots when we spotted Sammy's... I had almost forgot about this place.  There are a few locations around the city with two downtown (I think?).  The one we went to is close to 6th St. I think.  You walk in and it looks like anyother dumpy yinzer bar with a poke machine to the left next to the cigarette vending.  There is a large bar in the center of the restaurant with plenty of regulars having a lunch beer. It's relatively dark inside and for somereason really muggy, not sure why because it's relatively cool outside.  There also is a few larger tables on the right where we decide to sit.  At first we all sat down thinking that there was a server, there wasn't.  So, we looked a little dumb (not the first time), then we realized that you actually order and pay yourself in the back.  In the back there is a deli counter with large coolers to also purchase beer by the 6 pack (I guess).  I order for Ray and myself.  I get one corned beef on rye with swiss and a side of dark mustard.  I also get another corned beef with cole slaw as the topping for us. Tom gets the corned beef with cole slaw ontop.  I also order a couple orders of macaroni salad and grab a couple of iced teas out of the cooler.  We walk back to the table and I first sample the macaroni salad, not good...not good at all...The flavor is somewhat offputting and there also is something sweet like cinammon in it.  I only have a bite.  Now, the sandwiches are great!  I had a 1/2 of the Corned Beef on rye wiht mustard and it's great!  The bread is fresh, the mustard is cgood quality and the corned beef is delicious piled high packed with flavor.  The other 1/2 I tried with the coleslaw on top is also delicious the coleslaw is creamy and is the perfect topping for the savory corned beef.  I'm glad I re-discovered this place and the next time I'll just get a sandwich to go.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-TSFapUMwdyyxoi2egkOhw"}

It's got a very casual atmosphere. The food service is almost \"cafeteria style\" meaning you get in line, place your order and by the time you get to the register your sandwich is either wrapped for takeout or in a basket ready to be paid for. You can then seat yourself at either the bar or at one of the tables. It's unique in the fact that it could be classified as either a deli a restaurant or a bar. As a deli you can purchase corned beef and other lunch meats and deli items by the pound. As a restaurant you can get a good sandwich, salad, and/or side for lunch. But then again, it's a full service bar with a few craft beers on tap and you could get a cocktail or beer and also enjoy some grub.\n\nI was in the mood for a quality sandwich today so I stopped in and had the \"Famous Special\" -- a sandwich that sports a generous portion of corned beef with your choice of slaw or kraut (I got the kraut), a slice of Swiss cheese and Russian dressing all between two slices of fresh bread from a local North Side bakery called the Breadworks (I got the marble although I could have chosen rye, wheat, white, Russian rye, a Kaiser roll or an onion roll). A pickle wedge on the side compliments the sandwich nicely. Although there was a line of about ten people in front of me, I don't think it took more than three minutes to get my sandwich. The staff behind the counter don't do much chatting with the customers and its clear efficiency (without being rude) is the rule. \n\nI had wanted a quality sandwich in and a quality sandwich is what I got.

We found Zorba's on the corner and considering how cold it was neither of us felt like walking to search for food.  \n\nWe stumbled in here after reading the outdoor menu mentioning specials. The hubby  ordered the buffalo chicken salad which is the special on Wednesdays. I went with the gyro salad which came with a side of pita bread. The hubby's salad was huge, topped with fries and plenty of chicken, not to mention lettuce. He choose balsamic dressing which I thought was weird but he enjoyed it. The fries were great, nice and hot while the chicken was mildly spicy but a little bit dry.\n\nMy salad was just as big but it was mostly lettuce. At first I thought they were a little scant on the lamb meat but  almost like the loaves of bread that Jesus fed to the hungry, it just kept showing up. I was a little disappointed at the quality of lettuce. I hate those big crunchy chunks that you find close the root, they are so bitter no matter how much dressing you use. \n\nSo the reason I give this place only 3 stars is because of my salad. Crunchy bitter lettuce, gyro meat was a luke warm instead of hot which after 5 minutes made it cold because of the chilled dressing. Not to mention the dressing was rather bland and they didn't add enough to my huge salad so i ended up ordering more which cost 75 cents. The fact that I had to order more dressing even though it had little to no flavor was disappointing. \n\nThere is enough seating in here but just some simple tables and chairs spread out, nothing fancy or worth taking pictures for. It's almost like a cheap cafeteria which I don't mind if the foods good but I wasn't impressed with my gyro meat or with the chicken on the salad.

The decor was a bit more impressive than the service and the food were. Not that they were bad. They just didn't quite meet my expectations.\n\nFirst, even though we had a reservation, it couldn't be found. Then it was, but it was on the \"wait list\". Then we were seated right away..... but away from the hubbub of the main dining room at a table between the bar and the kitchen. \n\nThe wine list (including MANY wines by the glass) was  nice. The waiter suggested a fantastic dry white for me, but I was disappointed when I wanted a second glass and there wasn't any more. The next suggestion wasn't nearly as good.\n\nThe waiter seemed a bit frazzled at times. Maybe because he sometimes functioned as a bartender (our table location gave us that behind the scenes view). Sometimes our used plates sat for a l-o-n-g time and sometimes (like when we were not asked if we wanted refills on the \"Pasta Trio\" they were oh so efficiently whisked away.\n\nThe bread brought to the table was wonderful, as were the spreads that accompanied it. One of my dining companions had the octopus appetizer which he stated was the best he's ever had... and he eats LOTS of weird sea creatures. My son and I shared the Caesar salad which was quite good. Was that a touch if mustard in the dressing? YUM! For our entrees my two dining companions had the \"Pasta Trio\". Both enjoyed them, although they felt they were inconsistent.... and not refilled as \"enthusiastically\" as hoped for. My grilled salmon was tasty, but a little fatty. I never had fatty salmon before. Kinda weird. The accompanying Yukon gold potatoes and green beans with a whole grain mustard sauce were DELISH! \n\nDesserts were quite good.

Actually, wanted to go to Piccolo Forno, but they said they only take reservations for groups of 6 or more and for two of us there might be a half our wait. We wanted a sure, immediate thing so we decided to try Lidia's.\n\nDRINKS: My husband had the cabernet and said it was fine, nothing spectacular but def what you'd expect from a cabernet. I had their Prosecco. It was good, not as sweet as I'd like, but still tasty.\n\nAPPETIZERS: We didn't order any dishes intended to be appetizers (you'll read what I mean), but we did enjoy the basket of bread and unique spreads (garbanzo and something, olive and something) that came with tit. The bread was not straight out of the oven, but it was definitely fresh-baked that day.\n\nENTREES: I ordered 2 appetizers instead of an entree. The first was the octopus dish, and it was THE BEST OCTOPUS I'VE EVER HAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tasted like what it was but without being too briney/fishy. Also had a great texture. And the other items in the dish (capers, etc) complimented it really well. I don't use the word delicious that often, and I use delish even less often. But that was deliciously delish. \nMy 2nd appetizer-turned-entree was the cheese crisp. It was tasty, but super heavy. I chose the crab and scallion filling for that one, which was nice, but I think the whole cheese crisp idea (essentially cheese melted down to a \"cracker\") did not suit me. After a few bites I decided to pack the rest, but haven't eaten much of the leftovers.\nMy husband tried the pasta trio (unlimited) and liked it, though he didn't rave about it. I think there was a spinach ravioi, some type of alfredo linguine, and a pesto with meat and a red sauce, so there was a good texture/flavor variety from what I could see on his plate. He ate two full plates of the variety of pastas and was stuffed!\n\nDESSERT: We shared the Tiramisu. It was very fresh and authentic tasting. I felt like there was a bit too much espresso/coffee powder sprinkled on top, but perhaps my palate is sensitive to that. Overall it was yummy.\n\nSERVICE: Friendly and attentive.  \n\nDEALS/DISCOUNTS: None\n\nOVERALL: Glad we tried it. I would like to try the other well-rated Italian restaurants in Greater Pittsburgh, but I have a feeling I'll go back to Lidia's someday for that octopus -- so freakin' good!", "type": "review", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg"}

This restaurant is pretty similar to Becco, except there is no \"theater crowd\" and the restaurant has a considerable amount of space.  The menus are pretty similar too, with the unlimited pasta specials being a mainstay here as well.  \n\nThe design of the restaurant is intriguing.  It has two levels, and a considerable amount of open air space which is punctuated with huge, intricate chandeliers and giant tableaux along the walls.  There is an industrial feel which helps the restaurant blend in fairly well with the Strip District; yet, at the same time, there is a sense of elegance down along the floor.  The balance was struck quite nicely, and it made for an interesting place to eat.  \n\nAs for dinner, I was disappointed that the 3-course prix-fixe was only available as an option for the entire table.  My girlfriend did not want to eat any pasta, so that option was simply not available to me.  I am not sure why they can't offer the special on an individual basis and charge a \"single supplement\" price if only one person orders it from a particular table, especially if we were both planning to eat 3 courses anyway.  I ended up ordering the same appetizer I would have ordered from the 3-course menu, a pasta dish for my second course, and forwent dessert for the same price.  It seems silly to be so pedantic about such things.  Oh well. \n\nFor the appetizer, I went with the Cozze ($12).  As an appetizer, it is only available in a white wine preparation, but on the prix-fixe menu they had a red wine (fra diavolo) preparation.  Since that menu was verboten to me, you guessed it, I received the white wine preparation.  The mussels were served in a very narrow, tall bowl.  The bowl was jammed tight with open black mussels, sitting upon a shallow pool of broth and crowned by two pieces of toast.  The mussels were clean, not a single one was cracked, and they were all open boasting sizable pieces of meat.  I had to eat about half of them though before I could get to the broth, and given the narrow opening of the bowl, I had to break the toast into pieces to sop up some of the broth at the end.  The broth was silky smooth and fairly flavorful.  I just wish it were more accessible.  The presentation was aesthetically pleasing, but not especially functional.\n\nFor the main course, I went with the Lasagna Bolognese ($16).  I was so pleased to see an authentic preparation!  There were flat sheets of freshly made spinach pasta which had the perfect texture for this dish.  The color of the sauce was correct too for a dish from Bologna.  The quality of the Grana Padano was pretty good as well.  The portion size was especially large making for a rather robust and tasty dish.  I was fairly pleased with this course, good all around.\n\nWine.  I had a glass of Nero d'Avola ($10).  The particular selection was decent.  I was surprised though that my wine glass was taken from the table and later appeared on the table with wine in it.  What was this?  Why was I not shown the bottle?  Why was I not given an option to taste it?  (It's an inexpensive wine; I can live with that one).  Why was it not poured in front of me?  And, why was it under-poured?  So, yeah, I was pretty much not inclined to have any more wine, given such off-putting service.  \n\nI passed on dessert and called it a night.  Overall, I think the quality of the dishes is high, and I generally enjoyed the ambiance.  They are missing all of the polished service that I would expect to see at any of the NY locations, though.  Also, I was annoyed with the structure of the menu.  \n\n\n3.75 stars", "type": "review", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg"}

Instead of romaine lettuce, most of the lettuce was iceberg!  And the dressing was too vinegary and did not taste very good.  And I had hoped being an Italian place they would offer anchovies on it, but that was not the case.  \n\nThe pasta trio was tasty and included a goat cheese ravioli with cream sauce, a fettucine with sundried tomatoes, and a penne with a pork ragu sauce.  All were good but I felt like they had been sitting out for awhile and didn't taste freshly cooked, and the texture of one of the pastas was slightly chewy.  It was fun to see them all come over with their bowls though and the guy with the parmesan was also right there ready to grate some fresh cheese for you.  \n\nFor the bread, instead of butter they had these interesting things made out of a couple different sorts of bean which tasted rather like a hummus so that was interesting though would have been nice if the bread was warm. \n\nI had the tiramisu for dessert which was good but nothing amazing.  \n\nThe atmosphere was really nice with some interesting artwork and chandeliers and the service was prompt and polite.

Everyone from the host/ hostess to the server to the busboy was very pleasant, accommodating and efficient. Our food was just average. My husband & I each had the Caesar salad which turned out to be the best part of the meal. I had the fish special - saut\u00e9ed cod with spinach. The spinach added a bitterness to the cod and the cod itself would have benefited from a heavier hand with seasonings. My husband had the lasagne. He called it just average nothing worth getting again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg"}

I flew in from TX to celebrate my parent's 50th wedding anniversary. Lidia's was the chosen restaurant and I was very excited. We were a party of 8 and were crowded around a round table. Five of us ordered the Pasta Trio and it was the BEST fettuccine and ravioli! The pasta was fresh and the taste was out of this world! The disappointment came when we wanted more. We sat at length waiting for seconds after our initial taste trio. When we were served again, I received a spoonful of fettuccine - one to three bites. Our drinks, other than water, were only refilled once. I ended up switching from iced tea to water, not by choice but before I noticed, my tea glass was filled with water. I was also bumped throughout the meal by wait staff walking between me and a temporary wall that was put up to accommodate a large birthday party. Fortunately I can get good pasta with much better service elsewhere. I really wish I could say otherwise but I will not be back and wouldn't recommend this location unless maybe for lunch or a less busy evening. I am pretty sure if Lidia experienced the service in her own restaurant she would be appalled!", "type": "review", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg"}

Lidia's food was pretty good, but the service was just average and for the price of pasta, they weren't very accommodating to special requests.\n\nMost of our group ordered the three pasta special. After the first round of pasta came by it seemed to take forever to get another round. The dessert I was hoping to get was 'reserved' for those ordering a special dinner that night, and when I ordered a glass of 'a dry red wine that's a bit oaky' I ended up with a somewhat sweet cabernet.\n\nWhile the pasta that did come to the table was excellent, it wouldn't be enough to sway me back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg"}

We were seated right away and greeted by our server almost immediately. Our drinks were never empty and there was never a point where we were looking around trying to get our servers' attention. Now, on to the food. Brunch is $28 which includes coffee, a choice of a mimosa, sangria, or a bloody mary, antipasti table, entree, and dessert table. This is a great deal, with an overwhelming array of food options. My bloody mary was very good and spicy. I tasted the sangria and it was good as well. As each member of my brunch party went up to the antipasti table, an employee would come over and try to sell Lidia's books and pasta sauce. Who wants to be haggled while trying to grab a piece of salami? I don't understand why the management team thinks this is acceptable. I was completely turned off by this and it was annoying to everyone I was with. The antipasti table as good, but not great. The caesar salad was completely overdressed and the romaine was almost brown. Why would they use old lettuce? You can tell immediately just by looking at it that it isn't fresh. The entree I chose was the pasta trio and they were all fabulous. I had mushroom ravioli, ricotta with fettucine, and a penne bolognese. They were all so good I couldn't pick a favorite. I would come back, but if I was bothered at the antipasti table again I would ask to speak with management.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg"}

Overall I think the dishes have complex flavor profiles and are enjoyable to eat. Their service is good and the interior is clean and simple.\n\nHowever, I would have like it better if they took it easy on the salt with everything and if the chicken breast was a little less chewy. It might also help to lower the price and lessen the portions. It was too much to eat. I'm not sure yet if I'd go again given the other options in Pittsburgh. I'd like to try the other items on the menu but it's too pricey if I'm to expect the same kind of food as last time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg"}
