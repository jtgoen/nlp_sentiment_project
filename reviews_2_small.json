'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.\n\nOn the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.\n\nWell, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.\n\nThe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.\n\nI was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.\n\nWe hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.\n\nThe mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. \n\nAfter the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. \n\nWell, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.\n\nThank goodness for the basic salad bar.\n\nEven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.\n\nThe irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.\n\nThird base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.\n\nFrom what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food. But apparently, mama has left the kitchen.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fNGIbpazjTRdXgwRY_NIXA"}

It's still just OK. We didn't have to wait this time (Saturday morning at 10:30), but there was a wait throughout the time we were there. The menu is very basic- no specialty pancakes, waffles, or french toast and only 1 specialty omelette. There were no meal options, so if you want home fries or something, it's extra. The omelettes do include toast. (Great bread, btw!) We had to wait a while for our food, which was surprising because we've been to a lot of diners. My husband and I both got omelettes and agreed that the contents were not really cooked with the egg. It's almost like the egg was completely cooked and someone threw the cooked contents in there and just folded it over. As for my mushroom and cheese omelette, the cheese was lacking. My biggest peev about this place is that it's CASH ONLY. Perhaps I missed it, but I'm pretty sure this wasn't noted anywhere on the menu or the front door. Thankfully, we had enough to cover our bill, but's not a good way to end the meal when you're scrambling and digging for change. There are a lot of good diners in the area, so I doubt we'll be going back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "b9WZJp5L1RZr4F1nxclOoQ"}

But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. \n\nFrom the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn't know the menu. As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.\n\nBut it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point).  I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.\n\nMy biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all.  And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. \n\nBut before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their \"mistake\" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).\n\nMy opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at.", "type": "review", "business_id": "P1fJb2WQ1mXoiudj8UE44w"}

( dressing on the side of a salad,  less feta on an entree and no oil on another entree) The waitress blamed it on the cook, but did offer to get one entree changed.

First, the restaurant itself is on a convenient corner st in downtown Carnegie's main street. When you walk in you the first thing you see is a counter filled with desserts and amazing looking house made breads. It rather looks like a deli counter. You have to walk around to get to the hostess station and then can go left to the bar or right to the dining area. A bit confusing layout, but tastefully done. The dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant. It felt much more upscale once in the dining area, but I did find the overall restaurant tastefully unique. \n\nThe food - A wide range of Italian dishes and seafood. We ordered the crab hozel as an appetizer. It was an average serving of lump crab meat, I had to ask for cocktail sauce. It was tasty, but cost us $18. We then ordered the veal and shrimp entree with sauteed veggies like artichokes, eggplant, peppers, etc. There were 4 smaller sized cutlets of veal and 3 shrimp. $28. There was no salad or pasta side offered. The dish was prepared properly and was OK. We just felt it needed something else. \n\nNow the bread that was offered to our table came in a small basket and was filled with a variety of their house made breads. The pepperoni bread was AMAZING! I mean really delish. This alone I would have given 5 stars. \n\nThe service - Our server was...well....I'm not sure what he was quite frankly. Annoying?Confused? Hyper?  He appeared to have no idea what he was doing half the time. Bouncing around the table, asking the same questions over and over, forgetful, spastic, etc. At one point one of my colleagues said, \"Is he on crack?\" We chuckled, but seriously! He forgot to even ask us if we wanted dessert, which was too bad because we saw some amazing looking offerings in the cases as we were leaving.\n\nOverall - If I were in the area again I would definitely stop in to get some pepperoni bread to go, as they do sell it by the loaves.

We were seated in the bar area by the sidewalk, which is what we requested because of the great weather and the happy hour specials. Our server took our order of a gingerale, fried zucchini appetizer, side salad, wedding soup , eggplant rolotini and chicken piccata ( correct spelling).\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed the bread & wedding soup.\nThe side salad was rather bland and unexciting, lacking flavor & texture. The Spring salad consisted of leaf lettuce, a single slice of tomato and one black olive. I would have expected some additions such as onions, peppers, cheese, cucumbers, croutons, carrots and the like.\n \n  We enjoyed the fresh air while waiting for our appetizer, but were growing concerned that it would arrive too close to the meal, so we asked the server ( bartender ) about the appetizer and he told us that he had forgot to \"put it in\". He offered to put it in at this point, but advised us that our meals would be out soon. We decided to just wait for our meals and forgo the appetizer which were looking forward to. \n \n  The main dishes were acceptable, not outstanding. The eggplant was very tasty and well prepared.  The Chicken Piccata was flavorful, but not as expected.\nThe chicken seemed to have been steamed or baked. It had no signs of being coated and saut\u00e9ed  to a rich golden brown. The chicken was just pale white.\nThe sauce was a simple lemon flavor, it lacked any depth that would have resulted from the browning of the chicken. I tasted no garlic or shallots. The sauce lacked that famous tang usually supplied by capers, which were absent.  No pasta was served with the chicken. The side of vegetables were well cooked, buy again lacked any real flavor. The would have benefited from a roasting which would have produced a rich savory taste produced by extraction of the natural sugars.\n\n  Once our meals were finished  our plates were taken and we waited another 20 minutes for the check. The server seemed more concerned with what was on television rather than his customers. The total was $43 and change.\nI would have expected the salad and soup would have been removed from the bill for the error of not putting in our appetizer order, but no such offer was made and \nI saw no manager come around and check on the customers, as is customary.\nI am hesitant to go back to this restaurant or  recommend it to anyone after tonights dining experience.

When I first came to PGH, a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game, drink some brews and get great food. Most of that is true, but the bad has mostly outweighed the good.\n\nThey have an excellent new tap system. Last time I went, they had Thirsty Dog Leghumpper on draft, and it was perfect. The system really elevates already awesome beer. Plus, the selection is awesome. \n\nIt is a sports-themed bar, so you can expect drunk locals, loud TV's and plenty of yelling. I'm sort of into that, so it doesn't bother me, although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos. Service is often slow, and they give the waitresses ZERO training in the beers that they offer. This is not a good place for trying something new, as they can't tell you a thing about it. \n\nThe biggest downfall of Duke's, though, is the food. I've had three different, but equally simple, dishes there; A Burger, a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders. The first was flavorless and cold. The second was passable, but nothing special. And the last were absolutely awful. Honestly, the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill, I had to call it an early night. I ate two of the 7 tenders (SEVEN!) and had to quit. \nTheir fries are very good. And so are the wings.\n\nI'd say Duke's is a good place to drink, but that's about it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1qCuOcks5HRv67OHovAVpg"}

Everywhere you look, there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult, but apparently no one was honoring that at 6PM on a Saturday. I couldn't even walk through the place without someone shoving me. AHHH!\nI get that Dave and Buster's is an arcade and that you're going there to play some games, maybe eat, and kill some time. When I last went there a few years ago, we there for my bachelor party, and while I'm sure we got into some shenanigans, I don't remember children running wild there. We were having adult beverages, playing games, and having a good time. This time, it was ridiculous. It isn't Chuck E. Cheese, yet that's how parents seem to be treating the place.\nOn top of that, the customer service sucked. The place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a Saturday at 6PM, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you're table is ready, but the food at Dave and Buster's is not worth a three hour wait on any day.\nThe hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. Next, i engaged in the most rudest thing I've ever done- I began stalking tables where people were finishing up. I would walk up to people paying their check, ask if I could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line.\nFinally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. It wasn't because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. After that, he seemed to come around a lot less. \nI had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. The fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. For $14, it wasn't worth it. \nAfter dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything. \nAll in all, I didn't like my experience at Dave and Busters. I remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. but between all the kids and the crappy service, can't recommend this place.

First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with \"Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you\". Finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless.

Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday!

The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly.

We wait...and wait...and finally just give up and go off to play in the arcade area.   \n\nAll but one of the card purchase machines were rebooting, and the one we could use didn't work.  It takes forever and finally gives up and directs us to a non-existent ticketing attendant.  So we again go off in search of someone to help.  We flagged down a server, who issued us a card ($56 for 375 tokens) and served us a few cocktails (average prices, though my rum and coke was teeny).   \n\nAnd we are off to play some games.  About every third game we tried was broken in some way.  Either the token swipe didn't work or the game itself was messed up.   It also wasn't the cleanest place I've ever seen.  They have tables around the place to set your drinks on, but most of them didn't look as though they'd been wiped from the day before (which of course makes we wonder when they last cleaned all the games that germy little kids touch all day).\n\nOverall, they appeared completely unprepared for opening (computers booting, employees not ready to work, soda gun at the bar not assembled, etc.) and not well maintained or managed at all.  The broken games were sort of comical after a while, but definitely not in a good way.  If you are really looking to do this type of activity, I'd try a different location for sure.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New"}

The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. \n\nAs for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it.

Then why tell us on your website that you'll do it??? \n\nAdditionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant's ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. Obviously whatever error occurred wasn't the waiter's fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had.\n \nOn a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; I've started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.\n\nFinal verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the food's nice enough.

The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.\n\nThe husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.

Incidentally, \"The Hangover\" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  It's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light.  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you'll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  I sampled Rob's long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  I don't remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie's I've been too.  They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  Maybe I'm being too critical... I tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... So, I settled on the hummus appetizer.  This was surprisingly pretty good.  The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  It's probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  All in all this place isn't that bad.  If you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and you're more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EoAY1JSVeJriBzId8lUQwQ"}

Went here to get a quick bite to eat before seeing a movie across the street. The place was near empty and there were three waitresses. Got seated and waited on immediately. Ordered drinks, and it took them 15 minutes to come...no, not alcoholic drinks, two waters and an iced tea. This should have been a bad sign, but at this point we ordered food.\n\n20 minutes go by...we flag down our waitress, to let her know that we need to get to a movie in 45 minutes. She said our food would be out in a few minutes. Another 20 minutes, still no food, and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. We flag down another waitress, she says she will find our waitress, who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitresses. She finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later. She says she didn't even realize our food hadn't arrived (well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didn't). After speaking with the kitchen staff, she informs us that she \"definitely\" put our order in so it \"must have been given to someone else by mistake.\" Because they wouldn't have noticed that that WASN'T what they ordered? Seriously?\n\nThe waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and, since we were starving, we reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, our food and the bill arrived. All that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. How generous! We shovelled what we could into our mouths, did NOT leave a tip (thankfully, we didn't have the added gratuity that John had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. Worst part? I opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. Of course.\n\nHowever, I gave this place two stars instead of one. That's because my food, when I finally got it, was perfect. I had the Greek burger and it was huge, cooked exactly how I like it, with delicious toppings. I really wish I could come back here for the food but...hell no.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EoAY1JSVeJriBzId8lUQwQ"}

Well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything has changed in a way that you can't describe and the place is no longer familiar. To me, that is Bar Louie\n\nI can't say the food is bad. I had an order of the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce tasted like water and the pretzels were stale. I will say I still ate them so shame on me. My  sandwich (the Mario) as always was very good.\n\nNow here comes the bad:\n\n1. There were fruit flies EVERYWHERE. I felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump. At one point I had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer. I understand that the establishment is an indoor/outdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit flies to hover over my table.\n\n2. The place is enormous and they had one, very nice, but over worked server. The girl looked like she was about to have a heart attack because she never stopped moving.\n\n3. Because of number two our service in general was not good. I can't totally blame the girl she did the best we could. I mean. I've played Diner Dash on my iPad, I know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one working.\n\nIt's sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again.

This location needs a lot of work.  We went on a Friday evening before a show at the Improv.  We were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat.  We never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received.  We got there at about 6:40/6:45 so Happy Hour was wrapping up, but I would say that the bar was not even 3/4 full.  There were also plenty of empty tables.  This should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction.  But we grabbed a table.  I am not a clock watcher, so I am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 5-7 minutes.  Then we got our drinks at 7:04.  The only reason that I know is because I was looking at my phone because my husband and I wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of Happy Hour.  That went out the window.  When our friends for there; they ordered drinks.  We finished them and left.  The server was nice, that is not the issue.  The issue was how GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED they were.  They had two bartenders on (I think) and not nearly enough cocktail servers.  The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with \"this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped\".  That is a sign that you need more staff.  I have never had this happen at any other bar before.  Get more staff.  We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing.  Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55.  We ended up going to the Improv and got food there.  Bar Louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our Pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EoAY1JSVeJriBzId8lUQwQ"}

And while I enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often, the problem is that things are way overpriced here. Even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that I think most of the drinks I personally like don't qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing. Once I stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here. Not even a large one, either! Sorry, but I find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since there's cheaper places to get drinks in the area.\n\nStill, the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind IF I could hear myself think when I eat here. But good Lord, they're just so loud! I always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard. Not cool, Bar Louie.

Now that my palate has matured and I no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine, I really can't find anything to eat in a place like this.  \n\nMy husband and I were running errands at the Waterfront, and we needed to find a place for lunch.  We decided on Uno because pizza sounded good to us.  My husband is a meat lover, so I agreed to let him order us a meat-covered pizza.  To counteract this a little, I ordered a tomato mozzarella salad, so we'd at least have some vegetables in the mix.  \n\nWhen the salad arrived, it did NOT look like the picture.  The menu description is thus: \"chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes with basil and garlic, buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic syrup.\"  This description is accompanied by a bright, colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce, bright red tomatoes, and a delicate \"drizzling\" of balsamic syrup.  It looks light and yummy.\n\nWhat we got, however, was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce, COMPLETELY DRENCHED in dressing, a total of four tiny pieces of tomato, and some cheese.  It was DISGUSTING.  There was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad.  I suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing.  Not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about $10.  $10 for complete inedible slop.  \n\nThe \"numero uno\" pizza we got was nothing to write home about either.  It was ok... very mediocre.  The crust tasted like it was undercooked, and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever.  I have been to Chicago many times, had real Chicago deep dish many times, and this just doesn't even come close to the real thing.  \n\nThe ONLY positive I give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there.  It would be better if they'd actually print it on the menu, but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort.  They are making strides, too, with their whole grain crust options.  I'm sure there's still a lot of room for improvement, however.  If you're listening, Uno, please work on providing your customers with healthier food - not just healthy options like salads, but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers (low-fat cheese, low-sugar sauce, less sodium, etc.).   Their hearts will applaud you.  \n\nAnd lastly, why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs?  Is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement I don't know about?  It's baffling.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6p9TlP2I8S4agxYMNFSDjg"}

This chain has done to the deep dish pizza what McDonald's has done to hamburgers, Pizza Hut has done to pan pizza, Dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza, and Taco Bell has done to Tex-Mex; it has made it almost unpalatable. On our menu:\n\nFrench onion\nChicken bites\nPizza with pepperoni, hamburger, and romano\n\nLooking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature, the food just was not good.

There were very few people in the restaurant.  The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  When our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:\n\nCoca Cola\nIced Tea\nPan fried pork dumplings\nSesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup\nChangs chicken with white rice\n\nOur drinks and my soup came out immediately.  Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything.  I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table.  I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  I didn't know what it was and didn't want to know.  Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn't expect to get the stink-eye.\n\nMy egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  The server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow.  I saw no reason to continue.  I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  The skins were a bit thick and doughy.  The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off.  I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  We finished our dumplings.\n\nOur lunch entrees arrived.  I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified.  This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken.  Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place.  It is always different.  Many of them are good in different ways.  This food, though, it wasn't good.  Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.  \n\nI just don't understand how anyone can like this place.  Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam's/Costco tastes better.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JDDeaNfb0JXD1NbznSIC9g"}

This was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better.  The fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw.

There's nothing really WRONG with it. The portions are big and the food is \"alright\" and the interior gives you the superficial impression that you're encountering fine dining.\n\nThe food is sooooo bland though. Everything you get at P.F. Chang's you can get elsewhere in Pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it'll be made with more precision and have better flavor. The honey chicken at P.F. Chang's was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.\n\nLast time we were there the server was horrendous as well. I don't think I've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. He brought my girlfriend's father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.\n\nObviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant.

You have your corporate headquarters within walking distance and this is all you can serve up? \n\nMy husband and I were craving a late night snack after seeing a movie a couple weekends ago and decided to try this Eat 'N Park location for the first time. I had always been adequately satisfied at other locations so I thought this restaurant would be worth a try.\n\nI ordered several items - Sweet Potato Fries with Apple Butter Dip, Hot Chocolate, and Pumpkin Creme Pie. I think my husband ordered some sort of burger or sandwich. Anyway, every item was problematic in some way. The fries were good, but the apple butter was oddly thick and sweet. The hot chocolate had \"creative\" chocolate syrup drizzling, that was running all down the cup and saucer. I had to carefully drink the beverage - which was OK - because I was afraid that I would get the syrup all over my hand, face, and clothes. The pumpkin creme pie looked like it was sliced by a 5 year old. It looked like it had been carelessly cut and plopped onto the plate, where it appeared very flat and unappetizing.\n\nHowever, our waitress was the sweetest, middle-aged woman! Our food took a little time to get to our table (not too bad though) and she comped two of the items (I believe the Hot Chocolate and the pie) from our bill. She was very attentive and kind while we dined there, and I made sure that my husband gave her a good tip. If I remembered her name, I would definitely mention it in this review.\n\nHowever, despite our kind service, I'm not planning on returning to this location any time soon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eznh0XjVtv924K-KYx_ilQ"}

We sat there for 20 minutes without drinks, in fact some meals started coming out and we still didn't have our beverages.  Half the table had Pepsi or Diet Pepsi, the other half had water and two people had dr. pepper.  I'm not sure why they couldn't just get pitchers.....I got the salad bar only, it was ok but it was messy so when you went to add items other items were mixed in which is kind of gross, I thought the chili was overly salty.  The other people we were with didn't have much good to say about their meals, with the exception of the angus burger.  Janee did stop and take a picture of our whole table which was nice and we were there three hours so she did earn her pay, but she set the expectation high that she knew what she was doing and it fell flat pretty fast.  I'm not sure it was all her fault as she didn't seem to have a staff that was working to support her, just catch her up as needed.  I think if you have 20 people at a table 2-3 staff members would make you more successful.  When we went to leave I bought a dozen of the sugar cookies.  The person at the counter didn't know how to ring them up and was quite rude when I asked for her to ring them up, like I was doing her a disservice by asking to purchase the restaurant's products.

I immediately returned the dish and the young and nice manager came over to make it right, so I reordered a different steamed shrimp and scallops dish which was much better- 5 larger shrimp and 5 sea scallops over spinach and veggies with a soy sauce on the side - very nice but wish they had drained the ingredients better so they didn't end up on a soupy broth.  Having waited tables in a high end seafood restaurant through graduate school I am tempted to attributing this experience to Monday night, late dinner, inexperienced cooks, and lack of kitchen or server oversight.

Keep in mind that I haven't had pizza from this place yet!\n\nTheir steak hoagie is middling-good; nothing to write home about, but a pretty good example of the standard Pittsburgh pizza place steak hoagie.\n\nThe seafood calzone is another story. Something in it was so bitter I couldn't quite eat it; I'm wondering if it was the garlic or perhaps a leftover burnt taste from the oven. Whatever it was, it was gross. The shrimp weren't that good either, suffering as they did from that certain \"I taste like iodine\" flavor.\n\nThe advantage to R&B is that they're open reasonably late, given the location, but the phone service is rather surly and it always takes them an hour plus to deliver. Which would be OK if I didn't live a block away (normally I'd just walk and pick it up, but just for you, Yelpers, I subject myself to the vagaries of sitting on my rear end on the couch waiting for my food to arrive).", "type": "review", "business_id": "T49ZvBa6mD4xHSmjHe-ArA"}

My fiance, a friend and I were trying pizza from three different places and Luigi's was one of them.  I have driven by Luigi's many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever I was looking for a pizza place I had not yet tried in the Bellevue area.  Whenever I called to place my order I was told that my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes.  I arrived closer to 30 minutes later and was immediately confused whenever I walked into the restaurant.  You see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and I didn't immediately see the are where I would get my pizza from.  Finally after a few steps into the restaurant I noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where I needed to be and I made my way back there.  My pizza was ready for me and I quickly paid and was leaving whenever the cashier told me \"Stay out of trouble\".  I really hope that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else.  The pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a bland sauce which is weird since I could see a ton of green herbs in it.  The cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which I did not enjoy.  Out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that 3/4 of it was left after the evening.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will probably not head back to Luigi's in the future.  I just don't see myself making a trip to Luigi's between the weird experience (although not bad) that I had in the restaurant and the fact that there are much better pizza places nearby.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eOv0Dbq2E8sd0CKMAqTImw"}

We decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of TV's.  The beer list that they had was nice with about 20 different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles.  I ended up having the Philly Shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the Long Trails Porter.  It was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me.\n\nFor dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the Blues BBQ Pork Nachos.  We were told that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it.  At this point we were also told that they did not have any veggie burgers as well.  So we started out with the Chicken Chili Nachos.  They were pretty good and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking.  For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa's Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples.  Upon receiving the salad I dug in.  The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad.  However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad.  Whenever the waitress came back to check on us I asked about the missing apples.  She went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left.  I am not normally one to complain but I feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that I should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred.  It is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nThe bottom line is that I have been here before and the food is generally good.   However, leaving a major part off an item and being told that the kitchen is out without any rectification will make me think twice before returning here again.  It is a shame because Buffalo Blues does have potential.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ts4xsKPU7FNPPZRj-nRjIg"}

We were seated all the way in the back of the restaurant/bar, in a room that I didn't even know existed, so apparently Buffalo Blues is bigger than I thought.  It's nice that they have some tables away from the main bar area.\n\nI went for the Hot Veggie Sandwich with sweet potato fries, in some kind of attempt to be healthy.  The sweet potato fries weren't too bad, with a good flaky crisp.  The sandwich left something to be desired.  It wasn't hot, first of all - I'd say the (slightly crumbly) bread had been toasted with the cheese, but all the veggie ingredients were cold, leaving an overall lukewarm effect on the sandwich.  The hummus spread didn't taste much like hummus, and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy.  There wasn't a lot of exciting flavor,  It was just belly-filler, really.  I guess that's what I get for trying to order healthy here.  \n\nI just wasn't much interested in it, and I don't think it was worth anywhere near $8.  I better have a darn good sandwich if I'm paying $8.  Also, it was relatively small in size - I don't have a huge appetite, so that wasn't a problem.  But I guess I think an $8 sandwich should either be awesomely delicious, or big enough that I can take half home.

Much better view to see the Material girl! So our server gets 5 STARS! Not only for that reason, she kept the glasses full and kept checking in with us, and took it all in stride as we ordered at different times and all had separate checks. Very classy, wish I could remember her name. Young girl with dirty blond hair. \n\nThe food was pretty blah in my opinion. Bar food none too exceptional. We had nachos that were on slightly stale chips. Good size. Everyone had a burger or sandwich. As I glanced over to my friends Pulled pork it looked dry and sad left sitting on the plate. She said it was \"EH\". I ordered a Gobbler Club sandwich. It was humongous but not that tasty, pretty dry. How can you go wrong with a club but the thick cuts of turkey did not sit well with me and I didn't like it at all. Bad texture. The commercials and time with fun friends saved the experience but I wouldn't go back to eat. Just drinks and sports. I like the location. Easy to park. Close to shadyside.

It really is a Pittsburgh staple but come on....\n\nFood is really, really average. I love the ribs and wings, but it's about the same as any other rib place in the city, only they charge an arm and a leg for it. This place is for the people that feel that they are at a real rib place, but don't want to cross Centre or Penn Ave. to get real ribs. It, technically is in Shadyside so your Mercedes will be safe! \n\nThe ambiance: The restaurant is always crowded. Not just crowded, but packed with teens underage drinking, families with too many kids that overflow to your \"space\" and collage kids who also spill over from the bar. IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!! Forget about a nice quiet dinner. There seems to be no consideration for customers at all. Last time I was there, there was a St. Patrick's Day party (it was NOT St. Patrick's Day) that took over the whole place. Though the staff tried (nah, they didn't really try) to keep them in the so called \"party room\" I was bumped into several times, spilled my beer, and couldn't hear my wife speak. But as long as they got their money; they could give a crap. Oh and there are like 100 TVs to interrupt any conversation at your table.\n\nWant to sit in the bar area? Good luck. You will see a mix of drunk people, women who look like high-end prostitutes and college kids who are only missing a beer bong. Also IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!!!!!!!\n\nThe \"wonderful\" Staff: It seems like it's everyone's first day. To put it lightly; the staff suck! To be sure, you will be waiting for your your drinks, food and bill for a very, very long time. Expect to be there for about 2-3 hours. The wait staff are forgetful, inattentive and very sloppy at their job. It pains me to leave any tip for them. Most of the staff are hot, stacked, absolutely stupid and should be working at Hooters not a place where your bill will be upwards of $50 for two people. Be prepared to be met with this saying, \"Oh, like ohmygod, I am so sorry i forgot that, he he!\" (oh she's twisting her finger in her hair while she's talking). You will get bad service...period (in fact, I can't remember the last time a wait person actually wrote down my order, and they're idiots so no worries).\n\nThe food: Kinda good. Menu is huge, you'll find something you like. But I go there about 2-3 times a year for the food. It is way too expensive. Do not take a date there. Your average bill for a meal with actual proteins will run you in the high 40s without booze. There are so many bar-food places that don't claim to be high class that are just as good as this place. I grew up with the rib sauce and love it, but for your average consumer, skip it!\n\nThis place is a wannabe sports bar that tries too hard to be high end.

Our server made it seem that everything she was doing was somebody else's job, in fact, it was mostly other people who delivered, which made it confusing in terms of knowing who to ask for things and whether or not to factor some of the fine service into the tip that presumably goes mostly to the primary server who was sub-par for upscale dining; our question for the kitchen left unanswered, \"the host is supposed to do that but I will...\" Run on. When I described the qualities I was looking for in my wine choice during beverage inquiry, she just stared blankly and waited for me to decide. The wine list did not include descriptions. The gal who delivered the wine thankfully did describe it before popping the top and it was determined that I did not want this cheapest option before me! She described another bubbly that sounded and was, according to my own tastes, delightful. \n\nI was so very satisfied with the sparkling sensation of the meal that I sought it out at the Wine and Spirits store. This was the moment that my minor disappointment in the value of my special-occasion dinner at Casbah turned into a feeling of devastating violation. I am talking about a 400% markup on the retail price of this wine. If you want to do your own math: at Casbah the 1/2 bottle of Gruet Blanc Du Noirs cost $35, while a WHOLE bottle at W&S is priced at $16.99. You can bet that I will choose to enjoy this wine elsewhere, like Avenue B (byob), next time. \n\nCasbah is lacking the quality service, honesty and original ambiance that should accompany creative food at moderately high prices.\n\n**Update: I recently saw a full size bottle of the Gruet on a restaurant menu for $30; Casbah, take a tip!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}

We went during happy hour last week and I had the worst tasting rye drink possible - described as rye with fig jam, bitters and lemon, sounded like something that cannot possibly be fucked up, but tasted like nothing but the juice wrenched out of unripe lemons - super dry and gave me a stomach ache. No fig flavor to be detected. To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a \"yes, it's got lemon in it.\" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, \"yes, it's a lemon and fig drink.\" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks. \n\nAlso, their bar seating sucks.

However, I was a little surprised because when they brought my plate out about 5 minutes later, I could tell that it was the same exact plate. \n\nFirst off, it was not even warm, so if they made my meal on the spot you would think it would be hot, or at the very least warm. I had also substituted bacon for the sausage that normally comes with the entree, and if the chef had made a new plate on the spot, he would probably have sent it out with the sausage (or with a side of bacon again), which he did not (they had served my bacon on the side when they brought it out initially).

Here is a summary of our experience: \n\nPROS: \n- Ambiance is nice, upscale, not too loud. \n- We were able to find a low table in the bar within 15 minutes. \n- Drinks were good, generously proportioned. Cocktails were priced as expected for the type of place ($10-$14). Wine list had multiple options by the glass.\n- As for the meal, the meats were good cuts, well prepared. \n\nCONS: \n- Overall the food felt rich with creams, fats, salt without any particular inspiration showing through. The ingredients were all good and well sourced, but the finished products did not seem to elevate them in any particular way. \n- The service was high end of amateur - not what I was expecting from this caliber of restaurant. Our 30 minute wait stretched to 1hr 30min without any meaningful acknowledgement by the staff. Upon sitting we were told that they usually have \"excellent sourdough bread\", but they were out of it for tonight so we had ciabatta (which was fine, but we didnt need to hear what we didn't get to have). \n\nFOOD: (vegetarian options reviewed directly, meat options as reported by dining companions)\n- Cheese plate: Nicely prepared with a good range of cheeses. Only complaint was that the cheeses were served too cold to fully appreciate them. \n- Beet salad: the greens were good, the dressing was a bit too mild to offset the beets, the beets themselves were gritty and not particularly well cooked. \n- Squash soup: Overall very good - quite rich but flavorful. Felt like the salt and cream were taking over the squash \n- Mushroom pasta: Again quite rich and salty. Packed with high quality mushrooms but didn't feel that they were quite given justice due to the salt and butter. Pasta was high quality but again, overshadowed by the salt and butter. \n- Steak: Good cut of meat, cooked well.\n- Ragu pasta: Excellent pasta dish well cooked, reported to be almost as good as Piccolo Forno's. \n\nOVERALL: \nA similar experience at 2/3 the price would have received 3 stars, for the price of the meal this was barely a 2 star event. We won't be going back, even with the lure of 2 for 1 entrees around our birthdays - the food just isn't that good even discounting the service. I'm sure they will continue to do well with a certain crowd, but there are much better dinner options out there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}

Alas! that wasn't to be. Our server (Seth) and the service provided by him can be described in just one word - INDIFFERENCE. He went through the motions of taking our order and bringing us our food but that was it. We were never told of any specials. We were not brought any bread till we asked for it. We were not asked for re-fills on our drinks or even our water. We were not once asked how the food was and if we needed anything else. On ordering dessert, we were not asked if we needed coffee or drinks to go with and so on. In my book, indifference is worse than bad service.  \n\nI could have looked past it if it was just the server's style and lack of work ethic (every place has some of those people!) but what really highlighted this lackluster service was that the very same server was providing exceptional service to a neighboring table with a much larger party than ours. Perhaps because gratuity was automatically included? I don't know but suffice to say I was very disappointed and somewhat annoyed. \n\nCasbah is not your \"neighborhood\" place to drop in for dinner and the food and ambiance don't come cheap. So the least they can do is to make sure that service is consistent. It is relatively easy to attract new customers but really tough to sustain them.  I hope this was just a one-time occurrence but I feel like I need to highlight it in a public forum in the hope that someone from Big Burrito sees this and has it addressed. \n\nI'm so disappointed.

Hip, quirky, vegetarian/vegan. Lots of owls and kitschy deco. I eat meat occasionally, but had a vegetarian buddy here to visit, and thought this would be a great choice. What's not to love, right? \n\nWell, for starters, the service. Our server was really nice, and had lots of reviews, suggestions and alternate ideas for what we should order... but the service was mind-numbingly, ridiculously slow-- and the place was half empty. Plus, even after two requests for napkins (which were not provided to begin with, and not available from other empty tables around us) we never received any napkins at all. I'm not really a messy eater, but come on!\n\nMaybe part of the problem was expectations? We kicked things off with the \"firesticks\" appetizer-- some really tasty quesadilla-ish things. After that, our orders (I had the thai salad) were just kind of... boring? Strangely spiced? I feel like the bar was set high with the app, and then none of the entrees met the expectations of yummy veggie goodness, and my dining companions agreed. I also ordered a cup of the mac & cheese, and it was awful. You know how when you reheat elbow mac & cheese in the microwave, and the cheese gets all greasy/gloopy and the noodles stick together? Well, it was exactly THAT, with some powdered garlic sprinked on top. Really. I should have made my own leftover mac at home and not paid $4 for a cup of that. Learn from my mistake.\n\nWe had planned to order milkshakes, too, but our server spent so much time in a black hole or something that by the time she finally returned, we'd been completely finished with our meal for at least 15 minutes. For $4 (and probably a ridiculous wait) per milkshake, we decided to hit The Milkshake Factory on East Carson instead.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g"}

I'm probably one of the few people that has rated this place with two stars.\n\nBut let me explain.  My friends and I wanted to try this place out and had high hopes.  I haven't heard of many vegetarian/vegan places in Pittsburgh so I expected to have some awesome vegetarian food.  However, from the get go, our host was absolutely terrible.  He did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward.  There was obviously room in the restaurant for the four of us but he had to \"look in the back\" to see if there was room.  One of the other servers eventually sat us in a clearly empty table that we could have picked out for ourselves.  Our first host came back, reiterated the same thing the server told us, but never gave us menus.  I had to go out of my way to ask for menus about five or ten minutes after we had been seated.\n\nTo be fair, our assigned server was very nice.  She was friendly and approachable.  But of course, our food came and mine was cold.  The potatoes in the hash I ordered was stale, old and cold and had such a small accompanying serving of bread.  Also, our utensils weren't given to us until after our food was served.  I know I may be sounding like a little bit of a snob but utensils should be expected before the food arrives.  Not to be completely biased, the rest my party had decent food.  It just wasn't anything special.  Definitely not worth $12 for brunch.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be coming back to this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g"}

It just has to be a parody of a vegetarian restaurant. Like, every time I start reading the menu I think Ashton Kutcher is going to pop out and tell me I've been Punk'd.\n\nA small disclaimer: I am not vegan or vegetarian and I never will be. I love meat. But I also love vegetables and fruits and pretty much the entire food pyramid. And these things can be combined to make tasty vegan food. But \"Texturized vegetable protein hydrated with seasonings\" is not food to me. Yep, that description of their \"chorizo\" comes directly off their menu. Eating vegetarian does NOT mean you need to subject yourself to these highly processed \"foods.\"\n\nLess processed substitutes like tofu, tempeh, and seitan are used as well, but they are mostly treated as a stand-in for meat. I guess if you are a vegetarian that misses eating meat, this may satisfy you. However, as an omnivore, why would I eat a faux-BLT when I can eat a real one? How about instead of trying to imitate the flavor and texture of meat, we actually come up with creative combinations of vegetables, fruits, and legumes that are delicious in their own right. What a concept! Have you ever eaten a vegetarian dish and thought, \"Whoa, I can't believe I actually like this better than meat\"? I have! But don't expect that feeling here. It will be more like: \"Umm...I guess tofu mixed with nutritional yeast is kinda reminiscent of scrambled eggs?\"\n\nTwo stars because I really like the drinks here.

The service was pretty bad. Our appetizer came to the table with our main dish and the entire time we watched the staff eat their dinner in front of everyone at the counter. I am pretty sure that three different cooks made our order, as the cooks were tag teaming the line while they were eating.\n \n4. Last, but not least... the volume level in the place was numbing.

They literally just threw the wings in the fryer and delivered it to us. So once we realized how unbearable the plain wings were, we called and complained about the sauce. About 40 minutes later, the sauce arrived. At this point, the wings got cold and our hunger turned into an unbearable rage. We tried BBQ, Garlic Parmesan and Spicy. The sauces were just average. The spicy sauce was so weak that I should've just settled with a bottle of sirracha. \n\nThe deliver guy gave us a cannoli as an apology....ONE CANNOLI....3 eaters! You get the point.

We called a cab at the end of our meal and decided to get drinks & wait back at the bar. The cab was taking forever, so we called a different company. As my boyfriend was talking with the cab company, a waitress walked by. We heard her walk into the kitchen and loudly announce to the rest of the staff, \"UGH, those people at the bar are JUST now ordering a cab.\" It was 10:30. On a Saturday night.\n\nI don't know if it was the fact that we were some of the youngest patrons in there (early/mid 20s), but we felt talked down to and disrespected the entire time. Maybe if we were in our 50s like everyone else, they would've treated us like adults.\n\nWhen I plunk down $160 for one of the most highly-recommended restaurants around, I expect to be treated like I'm spending $160 at your restaurant. Despite how great the food was, I won't be returning. SO disappointed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

The reason is simple, in reading the reviews below, I have to assume we hit Alla Famigilia on a bad night, at least I hope so.  The main reason for the low rating was the service.  We were seated on the third floor which is their bar area, at a high top table and the bar tender was our server.  She had to mix drinks for every table on the third floor, tend to the patrons at the bar and come around to wait on our table.  That was not fair to her and definitely not fair to us.  Her service and attentiveness lacked for obvious reasons but even when she was \"free\" she walked by our table without a glance and was apparently hard of hearing.  Furthermore, when ever one person got her attention for another drink or something, she said okay and left, without giving anyone else a chance to order.  The rest of the staff tried to pick up the slack a little but they were jammed as well.  Sounds weird, but I never felt so rushed in a 3 hour dinner.  The food took awhile, which is fine and expected on a busy Saturday night, just keep the drinks flowing and stop by once in a awhile so we don't notice.\n\nI also did not like that we were seated at a high top table.  I love the high tops for drinks and a few apps but for a 3 hour meal, these were uncomfortable, especially if your legs didn't hit the chair cross bars correctly (either too short or too tall).\n\nThe food was good, very good in some instances and disappointing in one.  I loved the pasta with Vodka sauce and the salad, both part of the entree which is unusual for a high end restaurant.  The meatball appetizer and the calamari and shrimp appetizer were the best things I ate all evening.  The biggest disappointment was the veal chop.  I love a good bone in veal chop but was leaning towards a seafood dish. I ended up changing my mind right before I ordered as I saw the veal chop brought out to another table and it looked amazing.  The disappointment was it was over-cooked.  It came out medium well at best (closer to well) and for $68, and for the amount they were serving that night, they should know how to cook them to perfection.  Not a spot of pink to be found.  No one even asked us during our meal if everything was okay or any issues.  When most of the chop remained on my plate and everyone else's entree was 90% eaten, not even a \"was everything okay\".  Just clear me out and get on with the next one.\n\nI hope to have the opportunity to go back and I will not be seated in the third floor bar area and I will not get my same waitress and give it another try.  I expected so much more.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

I have had this made for me by real German cooks so I have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like and this isn't it. It was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots. The gravy wasn't a rich and savory, it was canned or packaged with I don't even know what spices in it. When I complained to the waitress she said that most people don't like it either. She asked me if I wanted something else but I was in a hurry and ate the meat after I scraped the gravy off of it. I have been to this place 1 or 2 times a year and I have had undercooked potato pancakes, greasy rubins and cold sausages.

For an all you can eat brunch they do a nice job keeping things stocked and fresh. The omelet chef was very good making stuff just as you asked him for, yum.

The staff member gave us all a menu and mentioned a discount we could use for the day, so my coworkers and I figured we'd give them a try. And...I was pretty underwhelmed. \n\nFor starters, a couple people definitely had problems ordering due to a poor connection or something like that. Fine. It happens. But then when our food eventually arrived the poor deliveryman told me that he had no idea how much my lunch cost. Fortunately, I'd gotten that info when I ordered. But what in the world did he plan on doing if I hadn't calculated my payment in advance? Would I have had to call in to sort out their staff's mistake? Would I have just handed the guy a random amount of money and waved him off? I have no idea.\n\nAnd the food itself certainly left a lot to be desired. I had ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer, but they did not impress me. The cheese was anything but gooey, and I ended up eating a couple sticks in one bite because the cheese simply wouldn't rip apart when I bit into it. The batter on the sticks also left a pretty bad aftertaste in my mouth, so much so that I chugged Coke after every bite to try to make up for it. \n\nAs for the sandwiches, my coworkers complained that their hoagies all came with too much mayo - one girl had even asked for her mayo to come on the side. No such luck: it came on her sandwich just like everyone else. As for me, the ranch I had asked to go with my buffalo chicken hoagie didn't even arrive. I used some from the company fridge. And the ranch was the only way I could eat the sandwich, which was drowning in buffalo sauce and could have been taken out of their toaster a lot sooner - entire sections of my sandwich's bread shouldn't break off when I bite into it, but that's what happens when you over toast something so badly...and is what happened here.\n\nI currently don't plan on ordering from this place again.

Yes, the table was the bridal party and the bride's cousins.  Yes, we are all under 30.  But we are also young professionals and the ones who booked the event.  The servers who waited on the rest of the tables containing the mothers, aunts, great aunts, and grandmothers were polite...even when my near-senile grandmother started yelling about bandits.  Later, another server apologized on behalf of our bad server and mumbled that, \"he just must be on his period.\"\n\nWhile Atria's is fine for a glass of wine before a Pirate's game if a table is open outside, I certainly would never book it again for a private function.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Z101WZaISochG6g7tI2ZVw"}

I get it, you wanna have a mom and pop shop. But to do that you need to have great food.\n\nOverall, I just don't think this place is good, and don't want to go back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YUZVBdGmagwXV-yOhR-1GQ"}

So I offered to go with her and see if the food was still as good.  \n\nOnce we were seated and greeted by our waitress, we presented the paperwork for our Google Offer.  The waitress handed it to the hostess.  I guess they have to call for us to redeem it/verify that it's legit.  Well apparently one of the numbers was missing off the print-out and the hostess could not have been more rude about it.  In the end she talked to someone and figured it out, but she made it seem like we did something wrong.  Or, she could have told us there was a problem but then politely taken care of it since it is her job and there wasn't much else going on for her to do.  Or she could have talked to someone in the first place and quietly resolved the matter without us even knowing there was a problem to begin with.  I later noticed signs up all over the place about restrictions with restaurant.com offers - I guess they have several patrons who use those regularly.  Apparently with this kind of reception, no one wants to pay full price.\n\nMom and I both ordered the fish sandwich with mac n cheese.  The mac n cheese was creamy and the fish sandwich was a large portion and very tasty.  I ended up having to eat mine with a knife and fork, not even attempting to lift and eat it as a sandwich.  We left with full and happy tummies.\n\nTo comment on previous reviews....yes, this is not the cleanest place.  But I expected that and find it part of the charm.  The smoke from the bar is no longer an issue as a closed door separates the bar area from the dining room.\n\nOverall, it was a larger than average portion for a good fish sandwich.  I'd like to give it 3 stars at least, but the whole attitude from the hostess still left a bad taste in my mouth that the mac n cheese couldn't wash away.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YUZVBdGmagwXV-yOhR-1GQ"}

I hate writing a less than stellar review of a business. It actually makes my cold goth baby heart sad. No one WANTS to go somewhere and get bad service, thats just ludicrous. (Not Ludacris, close but not the same.)\n\nI have just recently moved to Beechview and the best part of moving to a new part of this wonderful city is giving new businesses a try! I have sampled so many tasty and amazing new food items and coffee drinks etc etc. I am always in search of a non-smoking bar where I can hang out, eat, drink, and get to know the locals. I prefer small bars with \"yinzers\" as they tend to be a true gauge of a neighborhood for me. \n\nWe have many friends in this area, which means that we got some great tips before we even moved in about different types of food, stores, laundromats, and bars. One of these tips, repeated from friend to friend, was The Huddle. As the name implies it is a bar where you can be certain you can watch a sports game of whatever sport-ball type you're interested in. It is indeed non-smoking, a handful of tables suitable for 4 people and a \"U\" shaped bar right in the center as soon as you come in. It is a cash only establishment with an ATM on site for quick transactions. The have free popcorn from a popcorn machine which makes the place smell amazing. It's been around quite a while which means that there is a great group of locals who frequent the establishment. \n\nThis is truly everything I need in a local bar. We had been in for the very first time for drinks shortly after moving in and happened to be in there on one of their two weekly wing nights. This are not the wee tiny wings, more a weird in between of some of the \"full\" size wings I've had other places that clearly came from giant monster mutant chickens (I mean maybe they were goose wings, who even knows... they were huge) and the teeny tiny wing night wings you find most other places. They have two options; buffalo (sloppy) and \"tanned\" which are buffalo then cooked again so they are drier and crisp and un-freaking-believeable. The prices are mega cheap and it's so filling and delicious we've been back more than once for them. I like this place so much we have even taken the handsome-boyfriend's mother there when she was in town for the weekend. (P.S. She loved it too!) \n\nMy dear sweet lovely readers, here is where I have to talk about something less than all of the amazing parts I've already mentioned. Tonight, both ravenous from too little food and too much work-day, we trekked up the monster that is Coast Avenue for beers and food and a chill environment (that would undoubtably involve pre-season football). We walk in the door and aside from an employee (other than the bartender) and a few people in the back at tables, we are the only patrons aside from one regular. We belly up to the bar on the far side and say our hellos. This is where I get a serious case of the sad. The bartender working seemed annoyed by our presence. Ok, I get it... I work sort of indirectly with the public I have days where I can't handle people. It happens! As customers come in and sit down, she greets them with a warmth that was clearly lacking. Ok. That's sort of disappointing but still fine. When we got to the point that we asked for a menu three times while she retrieved menus and took orders for the people next to us an hour after we came in... thats where I start to have an issue with the service. Eventually we decided to leave because I was tipping over the line to \"hangry\" and was afraid I'd lose my temper after the 3rd time we had asked for menus and didn't get them while she continued to warmly greet other patrons and provide them menus and take their orders while refilling our beers seemed to be an annoyance to her to the point of not even asking if we wanted another or the same beer and just taking the glass and starting to fill it (wherein I had to stop her because I hadn't asked her for another one and actually just wanted the tab cashed out).\n\nYes, of course I'll give it another try, I want this to be my local hang out bar. My service in sitting at the table or being served by the woman I presume is the owner has been great. The food is amazing. The prices are great. Don't let me down, The Huddle.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wan0X-oHpLgGTPXqaICZCw"}

My issue is that, if you aren't like other pizza places with your pricing, you should maybe tell me that when I call to order a medium with two toppings. We ended up with a $36 pizza that will take us days to eat, when I THOUGHT I ordered a medium with pepperoni and sausage on half. All young kids working there. No professionalism. No explaination of anything. 50 cents per slice for every topping? Well yeah we got 14 slices, so do the math. NOT a medium. Boxed up horribly, so on our 3 minute ride home, the box was leaking grease out of the corner. I was so upset over spending nearly $40 on something that I thought would be cheap and easy, I couldn't even enjoy the pizza. Its just whatever pizza anyway. \n\nSave your money and go to Slice on Broadway. 1/3 of the price,  staff is wonderful,  and they have a liquor license and fair prices. Slice should get half the publicity this place gets. \n\nNever mind that I've lived in Pittsburgh all my life and have never heard of Betos until I moved 3 streets behind it.

They should really have an illuminated sign that advises the customers.\n\n I'm sure you have gathered that this pizza is kind of presented exactly like frozen pizza from the store except the bread is cooked. I think the appeal to this place is that it is different - Some people go to restaurants where you can cook your own food because it's different but the fact of the matter is that when I go out to eat, I don't expect to cook it myself and I don't expect it to come half cooked. \n\nHad this pizza been cooked, I feel like it would be subpar. The crust was very crispy and the sauce was a standard tomato (no extra hints of basil or pepper). The peperoni reminded me of the peperoni that comes in Lunchables - actually the whole pizza reminded me of a Lunchable (except a pie made of 28 cuts is $35.28 with $.50 per topping a CUT!) To be fair, each cut is $1.30 and you only need 3-4 to really, really be full.  They really lay on the toppings - about an inch of cheese, 20 slices of peperoni and a handful of banana peppers for just two cuts with toppings\n. \nI feel that you really need to be in the mood for Betos before you go there. When I am in the mood for pizza, I am heading for the flowing, stringy cheese and the flavors melting together before it hits my mouth. I would eat here again if I get the craving - some people in the restaurant had ordered other menu items that looked to be pretty good. I wouldn't take somewhere here as a Pittsburgh Destination though. \nThere is about 10 tables in the restaurant (booths/tables) ... clean/reputable.", "type": "review", "business_id": "93UCt9OgWYmypZCpXtUu8g"}

I had been here once before but it had been a number of years prior.  Man was this place packed!  I had trouble finding a parking spot and upon entering the restaurant there were no open tables and about 10 people waiting for their orders.  Since I was due elsewhere later in the evening I decided to order four cuts of pepperoni to go.  After that I sat down on a chair to wait.  It was at this point that I heard one of the employees telling another that they should tell everyone it would be about a 30 minute wait.  Thankfully it only ended up being a 15 minute wait before I was out the door and into my car.\n\nSo how did the pizza taste?  Sorry Beto's and the South Hills but I just don't get cold cheese and toppings on top of a baked crust.  This is now two times that I have tried it and this time I was prepared for it and more than willing to give it a better chance.  However it just does not work for me.  The positives for the pizza are that the crust is super crispy, almost cracker like, which I really liked.  I don't know that I have had another pizza crust that was this crispy before.  There was also a ridiculous amount of cheese on my four slices which I consider to be a good thing.  As to the negatives of the pizza, the main one is the cold toppings.  To me it doesn't really feel right and I am not a fan of it.  This also causes a secondary issue of the pizza being extremely messy to eat.  Since the cheese hasn't melted together and also hasn't melted the toppings on, it goes everywhere.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I probably will not be back again in the future.  While I know that many people love it, it really doesn't do it for me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "93UCt9OgWYmypZCpXtUu8g"}

I'd never been to Dormont before and we were eager to check out this place and the neighborhood in general (side bar: Dormont is adorable! If it were a bit more convenient to where we work and like to play, I would totally live there). \n\nAnyhow, so we get there on a Saturday morning, and the place is packed. No biggie, most good breakfast spots usually have a wait on a weekend morning. I think we waited about 30 mins, which wasn't bad. We're seated, we order, everything is just peachy. Then things started to go sour.\n\nIt had been about 40 minutes since we were seated and we still hadn't received our food. Other diners who were seated after us had received their food and were finishing up. Our waitress hadn't stopped by our table in a long time. I had started to wonder if maybe our ticket was lost (ordinarily I wouldn't think anything of it, but the fact that people seated after us had gotten their food made me think something might have been wrong). Anyway, so the next time we see our waitress walk by, we flag her down and ask her if she knew when our food would be out. We asked politely. We weren't snarky, we weren't mean, we didn't roll our eyes or snap our fingers. It was a simple question, one that I think many would probably ask. And the waitress replied, \"Are you really hungry or just really impatient?\" No hint of a smile on her face. No twinkle in her eyes. It was clear that she wasn't joking (not that it would have been funny anyway). \n\nHmm. Are we really hungry or really impatient? Well, neither...we just wanted to make sure our ticket hadn't gotten lost. We sat in stunned silence, unsure of how we should respond to such a flat-out rude remark. The waitress left, and finally brought our food out about 10 minutes later (and then we never saw her again except for when she dropped off the check). By that point, our appetites were pretty much gone, and we just wanted to leave. So we scarfed down our food and got the heck out of dodge.\n\nI dunno. Maybe the waitress was having a bad day. Maybe she gets asked that question a lot (by actual impatient people) and is sick of hearing it. But we were very polite to her and didn't deserve to be treated like that. I don't care how good your food is (and for the record, the food was okay, but certainly not mind blowing for the all the hype), if you have lousy customer service, I can't support you. And it's a shame, because I really, really wanted to like this place (it looks like such a cute mom and pop place). With so many other great breakfast spots in the Burgh, I'd rather go somewhere that cares about giving their customers a good (or at least not a blatantly bad) experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}

I've lived just down Forbes from D's for 3 yrs, and walk down there with friends a lot during the summer and early fall.  I'm also a former bartender and waitress, so I can say with experience and certainty that I've received just downright terrible service there about 80% of the times I've been.  Once, a friend and I stopped in for lunch with her kids and ended up waiting for the check 18 minutes after we'd asked to receive it.  We were both fuming, and the waitress just looked annoyed and kept ignoring us to chat with her buddy.  Another time, my husband and I came in 15 minutes before the ordering deadline, and watched as the waitress did not approach our table until exactly the cut-off time.  She proudly announced that we could no longer order food (we just wanted pretzels, for god's sake).  Food is pretty lackluster, although it's a nice touch that they have veggie dogs.  Upstairs, expect about the same level of service, with a douchy element of annoyed resentment from the bartender, along with even douchy-ier clientele. \n\nI know D's is a favorite neighborhood place, but I'm tired of the abuse from waitstaff who look annoyed that I'm even there.

Biting into a sweet c&s bagel and getting a bite of onion (which I dislike) is AWFUL. \n2. either wipe off the counter or place a new sheet of wax paper on the counter after prepping one of the above mentioned bagels with loose parts. Again, when you place a c&s bagel on top of these loose parts, they stick to the bagel. \n3. when someone orders a tub of cream cheese to go with a c&s, please wrap the bagel. If not wrapped, the container becomes sticky and messy from coming into contact with the bagel.\nI was a \"regular\" at the Market Square location before changing jobs and never had any of the above issues. The C&S bagels were kept on the top shelf and they wiped the counter off after EVERY order.The only good thing I can say about this location is that it has drive through.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uwiD9jxs09xxXG0by_xKuA"}

My great grandmother's sauce was the first I remember, she never opened a can to make her sauces, always using tomatoes she canned herself in mason jars. She simmered her sauces until every seed melted away. My mother's sauce was a bit more thicker, using puree and paste as a base, later adding whole peeled tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil. Her sauce cooks down to a velvety pasta sauce that should be jarred and sold on super market shelves.\n\nSorry on to my review of Olive Garden. seriously? Really? No! I will admit it's good in a fit of really, REALLY needing a pasta fix, or if you want to eat breadstick and salad. But the sauces are overly rich, and I don't mean the tomato sauces. I mean the sauces they put over the pasta with chicken, beef or fish. And, let me be real Italian here, pasta is NEVER the main meal in an Italian supper, Pasta is normally the first course and NEVER served with meat, including MEATBALLS. Thats as American as fortune cookies. after pasta, comes the protein, that includes meatballs, then finally salad.\n\nOkay, I'm done being a snooty Italian who looks down upon Olive Garden, I got out all my frustrations on you, my readers. But seriously, if you want good Italian food, hit up a REALLY good neighborhood, family owned Italian restaurant. The service is better, it will be cheaper and it won't go to a big conglomerate who over charges on a plate of pasta, which is one of the cheapest food you can serve.

So when I had the opportunity to eat and drink at SoHo recently, I can not say I was surprised that I found the cuisine to be on the uninspiring side.  Is it terrible?  No,  but you know that better is out there.  \n\nThe blackened chicken wrap was boring.  The flavor was missing and the entire meal was just bland.  Also, white tortillas just do not do it for me.  Why does it seem that Pittsburgh wants to thrive on fatty, flavorless food?\n\nUpon ordering the caesar salad on New Year's Eve, I was told that the restaurant has no non- or low-fat dressing option...at all.  However, I can order a salad with FRENCH FRIES on it.  Seriously?  The salad was fine, by the way, and is a large portion but knowing  that tons of calories had to be consumed just to get a vegetable in me was disappointing.\n\nOn the bright side, the smoked turkey wrap, which comes with havarti cheese and cranberry sauce was ridiculously good.  The turkey was juicy and melded perfectly with the cheese and cranberries.  That I could eat again and it would  fill me up all day.\n\nI also sampled the buffalo pierogies and really just found them to be the Mrs. T's ones with Frank's Hot Sauce on them.  They were good, but uncreative considering the price ($8.99).\n\nThe drinks here are decently priced and pretty good.  Friends I was with sampled a few of the drinks on the interesting cocktail menu and were happy with their choices...they were strong drinks.  When my co-worker and I arrived though one night to dine here, we were not offered cocktail menus so I just stuck with wine until I was no longer in the mood for a cocktail.  \n\nService on New Year's Eve was apathetic.  Granted, the place was packed, but we had  to wait for silverware and had our food and drinks pretty much thrown at us.  Even when it slowed down we were barely paid attention to and were hardly treated with any amount of friendliness even though numerous drinks and food orders were made.\n\nThere are a ton of TVs here, so it is a great spot to watch a game.  Even during busy times, there is a space for you but it will take a while to flag down a server to seat you if you want to sit.  \n\nI think I would stop back here if I find myself at the Springhill Suites again, but I definitely would not go out of my way to dine here.  Can't win 'em all, right?  \n\nPro-tip:  You can not access the restaurant from the hotel it is attached to (Springhill Suites) without a key and you can not leave the restaurant to get into the hotel without one.  Want some good people watching?  Sit and watch people try to get from one to the other without realizing you need a key.  Ridiculous.  Since you can access each of these places without a key from other doors, this does not make any sense.

That's because Soho is a kind of \"eh\" place.\n\nI visited for the first time yesterday evening. My boyfriend and I decided to stroll over the bridge to catch some Jazz Live in Katz Plaza (Roger Humphries - really good show) and then headed to North Shore for some grub. Now, I don't find any of the restaurants near PNC to be that good (see my Bettis Grill review) so I knew we weren't going to find anything spectacular. We settled on Soho because I'd never been there before and Atria's doesn't appeal to me.\n\nI did like the open layout on the inside of the restaurant. Looks like a perfect place to catch a game. Finally - a halfway decent TV setup, Pittsburgh! The bar is ginormous and they seemed to have an extensive liquor and beer selection. The draft selection was lacking, but they did have quite a few choices in bottles, if that doesn't bother you. I did not check their wine list, but I know they do have one.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered a chicken stir fry and I got a cheddar burger. My first thought: \"These two things should never be on a menu together.\" He said the stir fry was so-so. Ingredients were spot on, but it was lacking any real flavor. Someone mentioned this place as being a runner for best burger in town - huh?? There are a number of places I would put before Soho's: Winghart's, Burgatory, even Olive Or Twist! My cheeseburger tasted like a frozen Bubba Burger from the grocery store (you know the ones ... ). It wasn't terrible perse, but it wasn't particularly good, either. It was just so-so. The cheddar cheese on it was not very appealing - it tasted like one of those individually wrapped Kraft slices. Onion rings were tasty, but I've rarely, if ever, had bad onion rings.\n\nI would visit this place again if my focus were more so on watching a game and drinking than actually eating. Otherwise I say pass. In fact, skip into town over eating in the north shore at all.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FtjvnLhh51ZBYEpKAARaFQ"}

A round of Patron Margaritas were horrible.  They tasted entirely like sour mix and we couldn't even take more than two sips.  Of course, when we ask that they be taken away and replaced with shots of Patron, we were got the \"oh, you're that type,\" look and it took a while to convince the waiter that there was sincerely something wrong with the drinks.

Shrimp cocktail, crab bisque, and two oyster samplers.  The soup was bland, shrimp were large, but had a wierd texture that didn't seem fresh or like they'd been scrubbed to hide something, and oysters were not evenly sampled on both orders. One appeared to contain mostly one type instead of the 8-9 different types.

OK, I'm pretty sure Pittsburg isn't the most awesome place for sushi, but let's give it a shot! I started with the gumbo, which came out warm and kind of bland. It wasn't good at all.

Now, everyone has their own take on spicy scallop, but this was by far the furthest from what I could imagine a spicy scallop roll could be. \n\nIt was a small roll cut into 6 pieces (maki). It had a very small amount of raw scallops, which didn't taste super fresh. Then the roll was topped with the \"spicy\".

Not crowded but service was quite slow so I took off a star. My girlfriend ordered from their sushi lunch special and I ordered the bison burger. You're probably asking why order that when at a fish market. Well I originally planned on fish but I hadn't had bison in a while and it caught my eye. Well the menu is a bit pricey and I don't mind paying for good food so I had high expectations. He bison burger was mediocre (took a star away) The menu said bacon, but none showed up. No worries probably better for me. I felt at $15 for a bison burger this thing should freaking be awesome. Not the case. I would put it at $8.99-$9.99 price range I would pay since they gave me chips as a side. So they lost another star for over priced for the value I received. The girlfriends sushi meal was a bit over priced for a lunch menu. Two basic rolls and miso soup for $16. This would easy go for $14 at other places during lunch. So ultimately would I give it another shot? Yes, but only if it is convenient. I would not go out of my way or tell friends about this place.  \n\nHelpful advice for the OFM.  Actually have lunch specials. If you charge the prices you charge the food needs to be worth the price or you will lose return customers.

I sat there for a good ten minutes and was getting ready to get up and leave when the younger tender came over and said with a \"deer in the headlights look\", do you want a drink or something????  Well hell, what was your first guess?  I refrained from quoting Foxworthy and saying \"here's your sign\"!\n\nSo OK we were off to a bumpy start.  I didn't have a martini, however there was a few options on the drink menu.  I was just here for a bite, so my review is based on that.\n\nA few minutes later the other bartender comes back with my water and gives me a menu.  I ordered some turkey wrap with a fruit salad for a side.  I say \"some\" turkey wrap because it was really that unimpressive!  \n\nIt seemed to take forever for it to arrive.  Given the fact that it wasn't busy, it did take a long time to arrive.  When it did, it looked OK.  The fruit salad looked as if it was ready for the trash, so I bypassed that.  The wrap just had zero flavor and was loaded with lettuce........way to much.  The only flavor that presented itself was blandness!  It was very disappointing.\n\nAll in all, I think this is probably a way better bar to have a drink in then a restaurant.  I will return to try a martini, but I will pass on the food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OxIeMVcop5oxBUWANi-1Rw"}

The bar tenders are friendly and make great drinks, but if the place gets busy -- be warned -- the service can be tragically slow. I didn't have food, but the food that I saw looked good. My biggest complaint is the drink prices. I realize that this is a downtown establishment. It's somewhat upscale, but it's not the Ritz. I'm not at all cheap, but $4.25 for an IC Light, $7.75 for a normal-size Captain and Coke and $7.75 for a shot of Jaeger (though it was a generous pour), is a bit high for such a social bar in Pittsburgh, even if it's downtown, and even if it's somewhat upscale.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OxIeMVcop5oxBUWANi-1Rw"}

But in the end, I didn't leave with a sense that I really had to come back. \n\nThe real novelty at Primanti Brothers is that all of there sandwiches include french fries and cole slaw inside that sandwich. And to that I say... \"who cares\".  I personally didn't care for the fries and slaw inside my sandwich, but I am also not a huge french fry or cole slaw fan. (I like the good ones, but I can easily pass on average,) I will say that their cole slaw, which was vinegar rather than mayonnaise based, was quite good. And there fries were above average, but not as good as somewhere like say, Five Guys. \n\nThe ingredients in the sandwich were all pretty good. I had the Pastrami and my friend had the Angus steak. The bread, meat, cheese, etc., were all good quality and were distinct when tasted individually. The sandwiches also seemed to work OK as a package, but for some reason for me--aside from the novelty factor--they didn't stand out. I think that maybe with the fries and slaw in there, there is just too much going on and those two tend to dominate the whole sandwich. It really takes over and you hardly taste the quality of the other ingredients. \n\nOn the plus side, the sandwiches average about $7 each, and for that price, your get a pretty decent sandwich. In the end, Primanti Brothers is a definite must try if you are passing through, but I don't see myself craving these babies any time soon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ"}

When I'm in the mood for them, they are fantastic. So when my mother and aunt came to visit da Burgh for the first time they were intensely curious about local restaurants, and this one came up. They thought it sounded fun and different, but since one is pescatarian leaning to the veg side, and the other is gluten intolerant, I really didn't think Primanti would be the best place to take them.\n\nWalking around down town we passed this one, and they wanted to sit down and give it a try. It was a beautiful day so we sat outside, which was really amazing. We were also amazed by our server. By the end of the meal, we were amazed she remembered to show up at work at all. In fact, its a distinct possiblility that she didn't ever work there, and was just confused and thought she was at the greek place across the square. You don't go to a sandwich shop to be blown away by your server, but there is a minimum standard you should aspire to, and she was far off that mark.\n\nShe took forever to get there, but it was no hardship sitting outside on a beautiful day with two of my favorite gals. We talked about the menu, Auntie decided to order anything with no bread, with some loaded fries. Mom wanted a sardine sandwich, but only if its the sardine filets, she doesn't like the kind with bones. She is not one to make a fuss, so figured cheese and egg would be fine too. \n\nWhen she came around for drinks, they got a water and a pop. I asked if she had PBR, and she replied she didn't know. Then continued to stand there, pen in hand, ready to write my drink order down. OK then, how about I just have a diet pop. Before she ran off, we ordered our meals. I asked her if the sardines have bones in them or not. She looked up from her note pad and looked at me with a look that said {insert foul insult here} and shrugged. A big, slow, deliberate shrug. Not a word. And then just stood there waiting to write my order down. After a good, long, awkward pause, she said \"I don't know.\"  All three of us just looked back at her, waiting, until eventually she sighed, held her pad down by her side, and with a big roll of the eyes, asked if I wanted her to check. Yes. Please do.\n\nSo then she ran off, and started running food out to tables all around and refilling drinks. Running the sandwiches, she would grab two or three tables at a time, and then put all the sandwiches down, sort of paw through them to see what was what, and leave theirs and take the rest. It was just strange.\n\nShe came back, and without looking up announced \"Don't matter, we are out of sardines anyways.\"Facepalm! From the length of time she had been inside the restaurant, I doubt she even asked. Mom, very uncomfortable that her question had become such a horrible inconvenience, asked for egg and cheese. Auntie ordered loaded fries to start, then her corned beef with no bread. The waitress told her she already gets fries with her sandwich, but she wanted them anyways. I got balogna, just because neither of them would ever guess what jumbo means.\n\nOf course, the order came out quickly, and wrong. Mine was fine the way it came, but not what I asked for. Mom was the same. Auntie was fine, but no loaded fries every showed up. Until we got the check, that's where they were. Getting those taken off was another huge inconvenience to our poor server. \n\nMy Aunt picked up lunch, and left the tip. I don't know what she left, but I think that probably amazed the server as much as her server amazed us. All in all, I reckon she enjoyed our lunch together just as much as we did.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ"}

If I were serving, I'd at least pop over and say a quick, \"Hi, my name's Ali.

If it's busy, communicate that delay by saying \"thank you for waiting,\" or \"sorry for the wait.\" Honestly that's all it takes. That's it!

Unfortunately, it was not as good as I hoped. The cashier argued with my boyfriend over what kind of dried red chiles to buy, and harassed him when he was browsing the store (she yelled across the store: \"Are you done yet? I already started ringing you up.\"). The house-made corn tortillas were bland and only with the help of a guy running a nearby taco stand (who did not work at Reyna's) did we find the right chiles... The cashier had no idea what we were asking for.\n\nThen there was the Hatch green chile fiasco. Shortly after arriving here, I was searching for Hatch green chile in the area and found out Reyna's would be doing pre-orders. Hooray! I ordered and paid for some online. The website said they would be roasting at the store so I called to ask about it. I was told in a very rude manner that roasting would only happen at the pepper festival, which I would have to pay $7 per person to attend, just to get my chile and get it roasted. Okay, fine. The day before the festival I called the store to confirm that my actual pre-order would be available at the festival. I was mid-question when the clerk on the phone interrupted me: \"What? ... Can you call back later, I'm really busy.\" WTF?\n\nSo I go to the festival to get my chile. The people at the roasting station seem confused when I present my pre-order receipt, but they eventually figure it out, telling me to come back later to get t because it isn't roasted yet. We walked around the festival for an hour then went back, and there is even more confusion over whether ours is ready. Finally they figure it out and give us the roasted chile. Hooray!\n\nOh wait though. We get home and open it up and... Apparently they don't know how to roast it correctly. We bought bulk roasted chiles in New Mexico every year and never had issues peeling it before freezing it. This chile they roasted? It's somehow completely mushy and falling apart, but has almost no visible char, and it's fucking impossible to remove the peel. It's horrible. \n\nSo tl;dr - rude employees, both in person and on the phone. Little product knowledge.

The bun was Mancini's, so good start. The lobster was an odd orange color that's not what fresh lobster looks like at all. Nothing was heaped over the bun at all, but honestly after tasting it that part was ok. Combination of a few fresher tasting pieces, some rubbery pieces, and some dry pieces that literally could have been any fish. I skipped the fries, which didn't look all that great on hubby's plate and there was the tiniest container of coleslaw ever as a side that was actually pretty good.

This didn't seem too weird at first since craft beers are often served in different glassware. It was lunch time so we were only planning to have one beer and then head out, however we soon figured out when we could only finished half of our beers and my mother and husband had finished all of theirs that we must have been given a 22oz...not normally a problem...except it's lunch time & the beer we ordered had a higher than average alcohol content. If I wanted a 22 I would have ordered it but I didn't ..and we were charged for it when the bill came. We asked our server and she said that she just orders people 22oz because it takes too long to get beers and that way we do not have to wait for another. Again, nice gesture except you should ASK the customer first. She acted annoyed that we had asked and told us that only \"one in 100 people ever complain\" that she does this. She told us it was too late to fix it on the bill and we left the restaurant with basically two full beers on the table.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wHi8ODv7TGmeUB02XoX-mA"}

It wasn't very crowded and we were immediately greeted and seated. Service was okay not the greatest but not the worst either. Waitress came off as kind of nonchalant, but she checked on us throughout our meal and according to other reviews doesn't look like they even got that. Kitchen staff was slow in execution especially for not having a big crowd. \n\nI wasn't in the mood for seafood so I opted to try other things on their menu \n\nLOBSTER BISQUE -- \nHuge portion. I didn't expect to get as much in the bowl as I actually got. Although shallow, the bowl is large and you get a pretty decent serving in it. Despite the size, the flavor was lacking as well as texture. I've had some pretty delicious basques before and think it could be improved with a pinch of salt and corn for texture. It's missing something. \n\nGARLIC PARM WINGS -- \nGot an order of wings and they were good. Not an over powering flavor of garlic and not super duper oily. They used real garlic and it was served with it - minced. The wings were deep fried to a nice crispness so it added a little crunch which I liked. Served with common celery and your choice of rand and blue cheese. Not bad. \n\nMARGHERITA PIZZA --\nLooks better than it tastes. This can be easily split between two people - not a single server. The pizza is cooked in a wood fired oven and made very thin so it gets a nice crispy crunch. The crust was actually very good. It has a good texture to it and the lightly char taste you get from wood burning ovens was nice. I typically don't like that taste. Though I enjoyed the crust and what not - there was like no cheese on the pizza so it was way too saucy and lack-lustrous. Not what I would have expected so I was quite disappointed", "type": "review", "business_id": "wHi8ODv7TGmeUB02XoX-mA"}

My boyfriend and I were meeting my parents for dinner and everywhere we tried was booked for reservation only on Pitts graduation weekend. We ended up and Roland's and were seated within 5 minutes.  Our waitress was a combination of ditzy, snobby and bored. She was awkward and uncomfortable every time she came to the table. She is not a good candidate to be in the service industry, in my opinion. \n\nWe ordered the lobster roll sliders to start. There were 4 of us and they brought out three. No big deal- mom and I will split one....but the waitress only brought three plates. I ordered the Maryland crab soup (specified first) and hot lobster Caesar salad. My salad came out shortly after the appetizer sliders. I sat for 15 minutes without touching the salad as to wait for the rest of everyone to get their food. Finally it was delivered. My dad and boyfriend had the seafood stew which they said was good and my mom had the pasta di mare (she said it was just ok. Lacking flavor) and a salad (which she was never given and didn't realize until after we left).  No soup for me apparently. I requested the waitress please bring it out. She was unapologetic. \n\nWhen I finally got to dive into my hot lobster (now cold lobster) caesar, I realized it was just lettuce, a little cheese and the lobster. At this point I was so irritated with everything I didn't even care - nor was I surprised at the quality of my dish given everything leading up to it.  The lobster was good and there was a good bit of it plus the Caesar dressing which I always like. The Maryland crab soup tasted like chunky tomato marinara sauce and I gave it to my boyfriend to go home and use on his own homemade seafood pasta dish. My mom was disgusted by the clams in her dish and it was suggested that they were probably frozen. \n\nDo yourself a favor and go down the street to luke wholeys Alaskan grill where you get much better quality seafood for the same price.

My stepson and I were on our own for dinner so made sense to go out for the evening. So I picked this place knowing it was a kid friendly joint and not chili's or fuddruckers etc. The building itself is great. I loved the feeling of going into this renovated looking warehouse. He thought it was cool as well. The best part was inside. the decor is fantastic, and really the only reason to go. Loads of vintage signs and things and smack in the middle of the one dining room - a real vintage trolly car - completely renovated... of course I asked for us to be seated inside there... that was really neat. \n\nThen the food came... I had spaghetti and Meatballs and a Caesar salad. Now, the salad was really flavorful and fresh. Normally I hate salads in places like this. the lettuce tastes old and rubbery... not in this case. it was excellent. The spaghetti on the other hand - wow, watery, slightly overcooked noodles and sauce I bet was straight out of a Hunt's Spaghetti sauce can. the meatballs were frozen and reheated - i hate that off taste frozen meat takes on. so the salad got an A and spaghetti was a bit loser. \n\nMy stepson ordered the Italian wedding soup - he loved it - I did not try it... he also got the same watery noodles with the mushroom red sauce. Those mushrooms must have come straight from a can. they were button and the one I tasted had that tinned flavor.... so essentially this restaurant depends completely on frozen, processed, canned ingredients rather than fresh and flavorful. \n\nBottom line... have kids with you? they will love it... just the adults? find something... anything else... it is going to disappoint.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9mwShpTgZofOujt4JfyGmw"}

The decor is cool and varied and the place itself is quite large. There is free parking which is nice, but parking was hard to find on a Friday night. We had a semi-large party (about 15-20 of us) and it took us well over 30 minutes to get seated. Clearly they knew we were coming, so it shouldn't have been a surprised to them.\n\nOnce we were finally seated, it took 30 minutes from ordering our drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) to actually getting them to the table. We still hadn't even looked at a menu when the drinks finally did arrive. From there the service picked up slightly and we were presented with warm bread, garlic butter (decent) and salad. I dislike iceburg lettuce so this was meh. Given that we were a large party, obviously we were given a limited menu selection. I ordered \"The Incredible 15 Layer Lasagna\" and it certainly wasn't 15 layers, unless you count the loads of marinara on top as, say, 10 layers. My cousin ordered the same thing and ended up with a piece of chicken on his plate, don't ask me why. The lasagna was okay, but I've had better from a Stouffer's frozen meal.\n\nMoving onto dessert, I ordered the tiramisu. Might as well just call it white cake with \"espresso\" drizzled on top. It was still slightly frozen too. No thanks.\n\nFrom start to finish it took us over 3 hours to get our entire meal. Understandably, we weren't a small table of four so it will take longer, but it shouldn't have taken that long. Since we were there for a significant amount of time, we were able to observe what other's were eating/doing while we were waiting. Nearly everyone had enough leftover portions to take home and feed themselves at least once if not twice more. Good value as a customer, bad for a business who is trying to make money.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for some good authentic Italian, I would recommend going elsewhere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9mwShpTgZofOujt4JfyGmw"}

That one word sums up our group of 15's experience at the Spaghetti Warehouse. This restaurant has been a Pittsburgh institution for so long; however, it left many in our group unsatisfied and hungry at the end. My mom ordered the roasted garlic shrimp and her dish was dry and the shrimp were over cooked to the point of too chewy. I ordered the chopped salad \"warehouse style\" as my main entree and it was a big salad. Yet the veggies in the salad weren't fresh and the warm chicken was burnt and wilted the lettuce with its heat. I sent it back without eating it (at least the waitress was kind enough to take it off of our bill). My fiance got the lasagna and chicken parm off of the classic combo section of the menu and his chicken was ok but not great. The lasagna was good too. However, neither were great.  My aunt and father were unimpressed with their dishes as well but I'm not sure what they got so I can't speak to their food quality.\n\nAlso, it took us an hour after we ordered to receive our food and our food was cold. Granted, I understand we have a party of 15 BUT the restaurant was not packed by any stretch of the means. In fact the room we sat in had approximately 10 open tables. I can't speak to how filled the other rooms of the restaurant were though. But there should not have been a hour wait nor should we have gotten cold food as a result of it. \n\nWe have booked this restaurant for our rehearsal dinner for our wedding but, considering how poor the food was and how incredibly slow the service was (no fault of the waitress), we are looking to change our reservations to a different restaurant. We chose the Spaghetti Warehouse because it is close to the hotel where all of our guests for our wedding are staying. Given how slow the service was, we can't afford to be there til 10:30pm at night when we have to be up at 6am the next morning for a very long day. (Another reviewer said that their rehearsal dinner group took 3+ hours to get out of there).  \n\nJust my 2 cents.  I wish the food quality and service were better.

Seriously.  I remember when you couldn't even get in the door.  Now I walk in and feel like walking right back out.\n\nOverall, I've got no complaints about the food.  I think it's average and priced well.  The lasagna is top notch.  And having a private lot in the Strip District is nice.  I usually dine in but on my last two trips I was placing an order to go.  After the first time I should have learned my lesson and called ahead.  Never again.\n\nThe first time, I walked in and went to the bar area (as directed by the sign at the hostess station, not an actual person) to place my to go order.  But there was no one there.  It's funny, because waiters walk through the bar area and even use the bar to get drinks.  But it seems they don't like to actually wait on customers or even make eye contact.  After waiting way too long to even be acknowledged, my order was taken.  The waiter who ended up helping me, Andrae, apologized at least and was very nice.  I asked for two salads and he was happy to accomodate.  But then I waited again.  I'm not sure why my food took so long, but Andrae knew I had been waiting and threw in some extra bread.  Despite the wait, at least I felt like I Andrae took an interest in making sure I was taken care of and his apology was sincere.  \n\nSkip to the second time.  While I had bad memories of my last visit, I was hoping it was an isolated incident and gave Spaghetti Warehouse the benefit of the doubt.  Except....things were worst.  I start to wonder if there is ever an actual bartender.  But as I'm sitting at the bar, waiting once again for achknowledgement from an employee, there was not one but two managers conducting interviews in the bar area.  While this is happening, several waitresses come to the bar to get drinks.  Not one even looks in my direction, let alone ask if I need something.  I didn't want to be rude and interrupt the interviews being conducted, but after a good ten minutes of waiting, I went to the hostess stand at the entrance.  I waited a minute or two before one of the waitresses who previously ignored me came out.  I was a little salty with her, I'll admit.  I explained that I had been waiting at the bar as the sign says but no one was there to take my order.  She said she could take my order and again, I was directed to wait at the bar.  Back at the bar, their interviews over, I spoke up to one of the managers about how I had been ignored.  She apologized and said she thought someone had waited on me.  She then offered to take my order which I told her was unnecessary because I had placed it with a waitress at the hostess stand.  A few minutes later, the manager came up to tell me that she had deducted $10 from my bill and apologized again.  I wasn't expecting that, but at least it was an admission of their poor customer service.  However when I received my to-go bag, I only found one salad and one loaf of bread.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is....beware when placing to-go orders.  It's probably best to call ahead.  The service here is hit or miss on a daily basis, but definitely beyond a miss when trying to get food to go.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9mwShpTgZofOujt4JfyGmw"}

Landry's, who are owners of over 35 restaurants and chains many you would be familiar with now own Morton's too. Morton's no longer has a focus on their original identity, meaning and purpose but are being changed in a modernized way. On my last visit changes were visible. Some changes and cost cutting and commercializing has begun. The menu is changed to include items which will appeal to a broader clientele. Now profits and growth are a bigger part of the strategy. \nGone is the famous GM Bill. Bill was as much an institution as the restaurant he ran. Changed too seem to be the quality of the steaks. Our ribeyes were not a recognizable ribeye cut and the taste was not there as we remembered. One of three steaks came out drastically overcooked although the error was quickly remedied with a properly cooked replacement.\nI just hate to see the continuing commercialization of our esteemed restaurants in America.", "type": "review", "business_id": "90Fqfzd8zD9AuuNBSv9lAg"}

He definitely went with the better option. The pork was flavorful and delicious. The filet was undercooked, I ordered it medium and it was medium rare. Good flavor, but honestly not better than any filet I've prepared at home. \n\nThe sides left much to be desired. I ordered steamed broccoli and he ordered mashed potatoes. We had to send the potatoes back because they were cold. The broccoli and the potatoes were very bland not much flavor at all, and there was certainly a lack of presentation. \n\nFor dessert, I had the chocolate mousse and he had the key lime pie.

I went on a Wednesday evening and the place was totally dead except maybe one couple sitting by the sushi bar part of the time I was there.  Which is sad because they have such a huge space with 2 levels, lots of seating, and great proximity to both the Strip and downtown.  A lot more could be done with this place.  \n\nThe menu was printed in very poor quality with what could have been nice pictures of food options but they were super fuzzy and hard to see.  It seemed like their Korean menu was pretty varied but I had come for the sushi.  I ordered the Kim's Favorite Roll which was described as \"Tuna, Yellowtail, Broiled Eel, and Salmon\"  but what I wasn't expecting was the salmon to be cooked all the way through.  Maybe I  should have read it as \"broiled eel and salmon\" but that wasn't clear or typical of this sort of roll.  Normally eel is cooked but the other fish are raw unless specified otherwise.  Maybe you'd have a fried roll or something baked or seared on the top, but to cook one type of fish that is normally raw and mix it inside with 2 raw types just seems strange to me.  So it ended up being a really odd combination with the raw tuna and yellowtail next to the cooked sushi which wasn't so great all squished together inside the roll.  The sushi roll was quite large at 16 pieces, but I still felt that 18.95 was really pricey considering the quality of the fish was only mediocre with small portions, and they used a TON of rice. The quality of the fish was again just ok.  Not super fresh but not bad either.  The rolls (and those of my friends) kept falling apart as we tried to eat them.  It seemed they weren't properly wrapped or maybe it was just that they tried to use way too much rice.  One fun thing was that all the rolls came out on little boats, so that was a nice touch.  The roll also came with a miso soup, which was fine but nothing special.  The miso soup didn't have the awful taste some others here reported but it tasted like what I'd make from a powered package rather than made fresh.  I also got the shrimp shumai which were again just ok, and tasted like what I could get from the freezer section of an asian store and microwave myself rather than made fresh.  \n\nOne person at our table got a Korean dish which came with 4 side dishes that were all vegetable except for the fish cakes.  She said her food tasted decent but the beef bul go gi dish she got just didn't look right or have the proper color it should have had.  Just liked kind of dry and plain.  When I went to the restroom I was disturbed to see trays of the Korean side dishes in the hallway just sitting out in the open not covered or anything!  It would be different if the restaurant were bustling but it was totally dead and pretty clear those wouldn't be eaten that evening (so I shudder to think that after hours sitting out uncovered unrefrigerated that they put them out again the next day and hoped someone would eat them...).  If you aren't that busy there is no reason things can't be prepared to order!  That is simply lazy.  Also I overheard part of a conversation between a waiter and a guy at the sushi bar about something being \"expired\" and what to do about that.  Unfortunately I couldn't hear all the details but it was disturbing since this was after we all had gotten our food already.  I mean it's good they are being mindful of expiration dates but it sounded like someone had to be schooled on it based on what I heard.  But granted that I only heard bits and pieces so I can't say for sure.  I don't think I'll go back here again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dHDi4wCcjsOR6vcZ8oOIoA"}

After a first glance, I noticed that some of my favorite Korean foods were no where to be found.

We arrived shortly before 6 PM and with the nice weather we chose to sit on their patio.  Their patio is rather nice because it has an ample number of seats and looks out over the Allegheny River.  What wasn't so nice about the table that we were seated at was that for a while it was literally the only table out of about 20 or so that had the sun shining on it for about 30 minutes.  That may sound nice but it wasn't really as the sun was in some of my dining companions eyes the whole time.\n\nFor dinner three of the members of our party ended up ordering the all you can eat crab legs.  Our opening plates consisted of 2 crab halves (each half was 4 legs and a claw), butter and side orders of french fries and broccoli.  The french fries were actually pretty good and had a nice seasoning on them.  I rather enjoyed picking out some of the crab meat and putting the meat along with some butter over my fries and eating it all at once.  The broccoli on the other hand wasn't to my liking and seemed overly mushy.  As for the crab, well, it was pretty good.  The first couple of halves that they brought out to us were probably either not that fresh or were overcooked.  The reason that I say this is that the meat was hard to get out of the shells and more often than not you were left cracking and picking them.  Later in the evening though the crab seemed to get better (fresher or cooked better?) and was more easily pulled out of the crab without nearly as much cracking needed.  Throughout the night the three of us ended up eating 56 of the crab halves.  What was odd to me is that when we started they were only bringing out 5 or 6 to the table but that by the last two batches they were bringing out 12.  It seems like it would make more sense to do it the other way around as in the end we ended up leaving three of them.  Service of the crab was fairly consistent and it seemed like they were always putting in more orders for us.  However, the smaller amount of crabs meant that there was often waits of up 15 minutes between us finishing the crab and getting some more.  During one of these periods and having already been at the table for more than 2 hours I asked if I could get a refill on the fries.  I wasn't sure if they were included or not but figured that I would give it a try as the fries had to be cheaper and more filling than the crab.  The waitress told me that she would do what she could but never ended up bringing them out.  We finally ended up finishing out meals just before 9:30 PM and they quickly cleaned off our table.  At that point I was pretty antsy to get out of there since we had already been there for 3 1/2 hours.  That wasn't to be though as it took over 35 minutes for us to get the check and then another 10 to get it paid.  So the total amount of time spent at the restaurant was a ridiculous 4 hours and 15 minutes.  Yes I realize that eating a ton of crab legs is a labor intensive activity but I would like to think that we could have been in and out of the restaurant in 2 and a half hours or maybe 3 hours tops.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I don't know if I would be back again in the future.  While the food itself was decent, the total amount of time that I spent here for dinner was absolutely insane.", "type": "review", "business_id": "41CXLCeB8z2oNdIOvnrzIA"}

I hadn't been there for a million years and am not too thrilled with the downtown restaurant scene so I agreed. It all started when we were seated by the lack luster hostess. You could tell she either just didn't want to be at work yesterday or really hated her job. She had zero personality. Then we look at the menu. How much do you think they charge for simple bow tie pasta and meat sauce? You're probably thinking $10 or $12, right? WRONG! $20!! I was not happy about the ridiculous pricing, but my friend and I felt we were already sitting down and felt funny about leaving so we unfortunately stayed. Now I really wish we would have. I figured if I am going to spend $20 on simple pasta I'll spend $10 more and have a steak with it. I'm on an extremely strict diet of only 1200 calories a day so I could not have the bow ties with alfredo. All I asked for was for them to replace the alfredo with simple marinara. You would think I asked them to get Giada DeLaurentis to come and cook my pasta. The waitress gave me such an attitude and then punished us the rest of the time by ignoring us. After all that I get my meal, the steak is very good (even though it clearly was not well done, some of the pieces were practically still mooing) and the pasta was tasteless. I would have been furious if I paid $20 for tasteless pasta. Never again will I go there. That place is the worst and I recommend you guys don't waste your time or more importantly your money either. The staff needs an attitude adjustment, the prices need to be more reasonable given the global economic collapse and they need to work on creating more flavorful dishes.  The only reason I gave it a 2 is because the steak was good. Otherwise, it would have been a .5 or 1.", "type": "review", "business_id": "l2gPB9mqiHSbpwSUa7zrjg"}

The legendary steakhouse is supposedly the final word in steak outside of NYC and Texas. If this is the case then my oh my how the mighty have fallen. I have been to several Ruth's Chris locations around the PA, NY, and NJ area, but the one here in Market Square is truly a disappointment. \n\nWhen I go to a real steakhouse, like Peter Luger's, or the Old Homestead, or any other Ruth's Chris location I have visited, I expect to pay top dollar for top dollar steaks. I will never complain about the price so long as I feel as if the quality and quantity of food as well as the dining experience I recieve is fair in proportion to what I pay. The cheapest steak in the M2 Ruth's Chris will run you about thirty dollars. Normally, this would not be a problem had the establishment lived up to its reputation. Sadly, however, they did not.\n\nFirst, let's start with the decor. Ruth's Chris is a chain, first and foremost. That being said all locations are going to have the same basic look: old wood, magnum wine bottles, white tableclothes and red walls. I expect this sort of thing in a steakhouse. They are the last holdouts from the old industrial capitalist era. I feel as if I were to walk in, I might see Andrew Carneghie or John Rockefeller sitting at the bar discussing how unffair anti-trust legislation is.\n\nContinuing with the bar, Ruth's Chris offers a fantastic wine selection that has a pleasant mixture of affordable, yet quality, choices as well as a few that would cost me six months' rent. They also have a decent coctail menu, no doubt created by a corporate mixologist, that I must say is good. My girlfriend is not a fan because she can actually taste the alcohol in the majority of the concoctions, but I think that is a good thing. The bar is about the only place where you get the quality for the money you are spending.\n\nThe most dissappointing aspect about my last few visits have been the steaks. Ruth's Chris is known for basting their steaks in butter, which I do like. Fat is deliscious and that is proof enough for me that we are meant to eat it. This is where the goodness ends. On my second to last visit, a member of my party was served a rancid steak. The server tried to say it was dry-aged, but dry-aging does not produce a metallic, green beef. On my most recent visit, I was served a filet mignon that was tough. I have no idea how they were able to serve a tough portion of the least used muscle on the cow, but they did.\n\nAll of this brings me back to the service. I understand you are working in a fine dining, expensive steakhouse. I get that you throw down $300 plust dollar checks thirty or so times a night. I get that you are on first name basis with the Pens, Bucs, and Steelers that call themselves your regulars. That does not make me chop liver. I feel that if you are not wearing at least $3,000 worth of clothes or accessories, the staff will basically ignore you.\n\nThe saving grace to the place would be the bar and decor I already mentioned, and the sides. Ruth's Chris, like most fine dining establishments runs an a la carte menu. The sides are usually very very good. I like the sauteed mushrooms, sauteed spinache, lyonaise potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and the wedge salad.\n\nAll in all, this place gets a two in my book. I think that this is kind of sad given the fact that I was hoping to give them a five, but the quality of the food compared to what you pay just is not up to standard. For $250 I can feed and booze six friends at my house instead of me and my girlfriend at Ruth's Chris.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0FgwBx7pgmNdUtsd_T8UYQ"}

We had a large group before a theater show and I was excited to try a new place.  It's conveniently located for all downtown events.  They also have happy hour which is always nice.

I got the one with 2 months, go figure.\n\nI'm on a budget right now and pretty healthy, so I planned ahead to get a caesar salad.  I decided at the time to add \"shrimp\" (quoted on the menu as $2.50) and get a side of vegetables.  Now, the waiter said a lot of the dishes came with vegetables.  So I can order a side of them, right?  WRONG.  After I ordered, the waiter came back twice.  Once to tell me that they couldn't do the veggies.  Uh, what?  The second time to ask me how many shrimp I wanted.  hmm.  And he never refilled my water or asked if I wanted a drink.\n\nSo our food comes out and my salad is LEAVES and DRESSING.  Period.  The End.  Oh, with 3 pitiful shrimp on top.  That's it.  There was the powder parmesan on the table which I added myself.

The salad had way too much iceberg lettuce and tasted like crap. I won't be back until Pittsburgh decides to clean up Market square and all of the vargrants that inhabit the area. Where do these people come from? and is there nothing better to do except sit around market square, smoke cigarettes and throw your trash everywhere so city workers can clean up after your filthy asses?

You know how when you get a jokey waiter when you're not \"that kind\" of table, you expect the waiter to get the hint and be more professional? Well I had the exact opposite experience. My very small office was saying goodbye to one of our coworkers, so we went to Lidia's for a boozy lunch. We were in high spirits and having a great time. The waiter was perfectly courteous and professional, but I thought he should have gotten that we were a more personable table. Anyway, I didn't knock off a star for this, it doesn't seem important enough. But it did taint my visit. I remember the waiters attitude more then some of the food.\n\nOh, and don't bother with the tiramisu, it's all cream, almost no cake.\n\nBut the atmosphere is great, they really went all out with the interior design. The menu isn't particularly veg friendly, but it's not too bad. Lidia's does high-end traditional Italian without being too pretentious or too predictable. But I have no desire to eat what I ordered (the daily special pasta trio) again nor do I have any interest in trying anything else on the menu. Months later I decided to lower my stars from four to two. I really wanted to like this place, but I really didn't.\n\nAnd I gotta talk about that wine list again, it's Lidia's only shining star.

Everything is bland. They have a salt problem. They must not have it in their kitchen. Everything needed it.\n\nThe salads were the only fairly good items we had. The arugula salad with pear walnuts and Gorgonzola was well dressed, but the beets were not cooked to their sweet level. \n\nThe lamb chops were awful. Lamb tasted like the grill and not at all like lamb.  I sent it back. They replaced it with pork tenderloin served on a tomato sauce (needed salt) and with cheese melted over the top with asparagus and a slice of Roma tomato. It was a sad sad dish. The tomato was hard as rock. The tenderloin was over cooked.  Just bad.\n\nI had the chicken piccata upon the recommendation of the server. It had lemon, capers and green olives. The vinegar fought with the lemon in the most vile way. The chicken had that flour coated slime feel in the mouth. Served on a bed of spinach. That was the only decent taste on the plate if it didn't have any of the sauce on it. \n\nBread is awful. They have a foccacia and skinny bread sticks that tasted stale to me. Served with an olive spread and a garlic white bean spread. They were fine on their own - in fact rather tasty.\n\nThe menu is really odd. Just in the way it is laid out and with the choices. Two west coast fish selections. Halibut and salmon.  Coming from the west coast, I just overlooked them by a matter of principle. \n\nBut the worse is the pasta trio. The concept is just so olive garden. All you can eat of three different pastas served table side. They cart a saut\u00e9 pan to your table. What is that all about? Our neighbors ordered it and I over heard them talking to their server about their disappointment.\n\nBut like all things Pittsburgh the people were so nice. They were gracious about the lamb and took it and the pork replacement off the bill. \n\nI just have to wonder why Lidia would create a menu like this. It just doesn't match her books or shows at all. It does nothing to support the brand of Lidia.

The salad was very good as were the breadsticks and bread with sea salt on the top.  \n\nAs for the main entrees that my girlfriend and I had...let's just say they left a little to be desired.  The pasta trio sounded good until I heard that almost everyone had mushrooms in it.  Lidia's is definitely that italian restaurant that is trying too hard to be cutting edge.  Why not go with some standard italian dishes?  Their menu doesn't include really any.  My girlfriend tried to play it safe with the lasagna bolognese and they should have just called that a mountain of over-salted meat.  There couldn't have been more than two sheets of pasta and two tablespoons of sauce in that dish.  There is nothing worse than dry lasagna and if my girlfriend wanted to eat just meat she would have ordered just meat.  Lasagna does in fact call for pasta.  \n\nI ordered the halibut with polenta.  I'll start with the polenta.  Basically I should have just eaten my napkin because that had more flavor than the polenta.  The dish came with San Marzano Tomatoes, Olives, and Capers over top of it and water passed off as sauce.  Nothing annoys me more than when someone tries to go crazy with a fish dish.  Let the fish do the talking.  There were so many onions and capers on it that I needed to really dig for the fish.  The halibut was good but it's a shame that the piece was incredibly small because the rest of the dish was subpar.\n\nThe desserts were very good however.  We went with the Tiramisu and \nSemifreddo di Cioccolato e Caramello (Milk Chocolate and carmel ice creams, chocolate cake, toasted meringue, crushed toffee).  \n\nThe decor was definitely cool inside too.

Decor and service were just fine, no issues there. \n\nBut the food was something I would expect from a chain restaurant like Carrabba's or Olive Garden. The quality seemed poor: bread was soggy, greens and salad dressings way over salted, greasy, sloppy pasta sauces, and huge portions just slapped onto dirty plates with greasy fingerprints all over the edges. Plus, I spent the entire meal swatting flies away from our table.\n\nI was really puzzled by this experience. When you dine at Joe's restaurants, you get the sense that every single ingredient is hand selected for the highest quality and the presentation of the food shows care went into it.  I expected a similar standard at Lidia's. I wondered if Lidia visits this restaurant often and whether she knows about the quality of the food. Celebrity chefs often seem to suffer from this issue: they get involved in so many business ventures and if they are not at the restaurants regularly, the quality suffers.\n\nSorry to say it, but I definitely won't be back to Lidia's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg"}

Tonight was far different.\n\nOverall, let me say that the restaurant is becoming dated. Colors and decor seem boring and out of style. I didn't get that warm feeling I should in a place where there are white clothes, $12 average glasses of wine (like come on - I looked up the crappy bottle it came from) and waiters everywhere.\n\nThe service was horrible. From hostess crew to the bar to the waitress, it was bad. The hostess forgot about us, then when I reminded him we were waiting (40 minutes - despite a reservation), to which he said \"oh yes, I was just going to get you\"... But he wasn't because we stood there a few minutes while he set the table. Rude.\n\nDid I mention the service was bad? Well, while we were waiting we had a glass of wine each (a steep $13.50 glass each - definitely didn't live up to my expectations). The bar staff wasn't concerned with us and weren't friendly at all. They were chatting to themselves and basically ignoring us.  When we got to the table, it took 10 mins to meet our waitress. Then it took another 15 to order.  Then 50 mins to get our food!!! I had the pasta trio (remember this meal takes no time to cook  - as this is ready made and constantly being served) and my wife had the porkchop. Honestly, we typically enjoy our restaurant food (just read my Casbah review) but our food was really just so-so. My wife's pork chop was fatty and over-cooked (despite the waitress specifically making note of how the chef prefers to cook it medium). My pasta was decent, which I ate, and requested seconds (which is allowed for the trio because they give you very small portions).... However, seconds never came. Waitress didn't even know until I told her politely. Then she blamed new staff working the pasta routes... No good enough reason for me - sorry. \n\nThen the bill.  I ordered the pasta trio for $23 and the waitress asked me if I wanted to upgrade my Salad for $2, to which I approved. However she charged the $36 pasta trio (which comes with desert). I told her this was a mistake and she agreed and ran back with a new check. Now I had a $10 salad and $23 pasta trio. I was expecting $23 +$2 salad upgrade. Nope. So I explained to her politely that I ordered the $23 trio to which she (must have) mistakenly offered me an upgrade. I accepted. However I was told I was wrong and she didn't offer to make this right. Ugh. Seriously you want to fight me on it? Especially when I know I was being appropriately (not like I was trying to score a free meal). Isn't the rule \"customer is always right\"?\n\nFinally, we felt like the whole restaurant clientele has declined. How many people did we see in tie-dye shirt or wearing hats (literally wearing hats at 8:30pm in a fine dining restaurant)? We saw enough to know that this isn't the lidias we expected.\n\nWe won't ever go back or recommend the place.  As far as we are concerned - there is a very good reason that you don't have a problem getting a reservation here (because IT STINKS!). \n\nAvoid!", "type": "review", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg"}

We had several appetizers including the bruschetta, which was really only to my liking.  The balsamic was excellent - syrupy and sweet - and clearly a nicely aged one.  But it was incongruous with the rest of the dish, and so not many enjoyed it.  \n\nThe bread served at the table was really very good and we devoured baskets of it. \n\nComments from some of the other diners:\n\n- Baked shrimp appetizer was pretty good, the calamari was very good.  \n- Rucola  salad was (in my opinion) excellent\n- Beet salad was interesting and overall very good\n- Butternut squash soup was enjoyed by several of us\n- Scampi alla Felidia was ordered by several guests with mixed opinions\n- Lasagna bolognese?  so so at best\n\nGnocchi and duck ragu was what I ordered.  I was very disappointed. The duck was shredded and cooked into a sort of red congealed, thick mass with little texture.  The gnocchi were so underdone as to be a sort of glutinous paste sitting under the duck.  The texture was completely unappealing but I do have to say that the flavor of the duck ragu (ragout?) was pretty good. \n\nStill, the gnocchi - one of my favorite things and something I make myself probably once a month - were a disappointment.  I didn't send it back because it didn't seem appropriate in the setting of a very large group to monopolize the wait staff.  \n\nI'd still give it a try again when I'm there in June, but it seems that some of their efforts are focused more on being creative, which is good, but falling somewhat short.\n\nBy the way, if you like a more traditional Italian and happen to be in St. Louis, Charlie Gitto's on the Hill is a great place.

The groupon (meal for 2) included a $32 bottle of wine; choice between salad or soup; an all you can eat pasta trio; and dessert (tiramisu).  The first time we went, I would have rated Lidias with one star.  The service was sub-par on a Friday night. We were seated at a table too close to a service station and my seat kept being bumped into.  The bottle of wine we ordered never arrived until after we were mostly finished with our salads.  As for the food, the Caesar salad was OK, but I was really disappointed by the pastas.  The goat cheese ravioli was bland, and the other 2 pastas lacked in flavor as well (rigatoni with an olive oil based sauce and pasta in a meat sauce, which lacked in meat).  The second trip was better, bumping Lidias up to 2.5 stars.  We went midweek (Wednesday), and the service improved, although we still received our bottle of wine after the salads.  The quality and taste of the pastas also improved.  The pasta was fresh and had much more flavor (spaghetti noodles with red peppers, mushroom ravioli, and rigatoni with sweet sausage and onion).  Both times we got the dessert to go.  Our waitress also boxed up the remainder of our all you can eat pasta for us to take home with us (which was nice).  If you have the groupon, I would recommend going on a week night when they aren't as busy for better service.  I would also call ahead to see what pastas they are serving that day.

I'm a crusty guy, so I like good crust and though it's up there with a soft boboli it's still easy to eat and won't rough up your mouth.  I ordered the Ephesus Pizza with lamb skewers ($16.00 large).  It is a white pizza with minimal ingredients except for the lamb skewers.  They packed on 8-9 small skewers of lamb and I have to admit, the lamb was very tasty and tender.  The problem I have with this place is the filthy, trash laden environment it sits in.  It's on the mezzanine level (2nd floor) of a some financial building and when I got there, the exterior doors to the building were locked and luckily a group of people showed up and punched in the code to get one of the side doors opened...it was strange.  However, when you walk in that side door, I was faced with the stairwell with trash cans spewed about.  when I entered the pizza/sandwich joint, it was in disarray, bread was in crates on the floor and trash cans were overflowing.  The bathroom was in a construction zone and filthy.  All of this added up to being afraid to eat anything because you were unsure as to how fresh the food was and how well kept the kitchen may or may not have been.  I'm not a fluffy guy, but I need some fluff in my establishments...look clean, feel clean, feel safe and I can live with whatever you dish out, but when first impressions are nasty and dirty, it hits homeplate way before the food hits my mouth.

If they didn't, that would be fine we'd call someplace else.  So we ordered our two pizzas and gave them the name and address of the hotel. It is a newish hotel, so I told my buddy to tell them \"It's right by the Consol Energy Center, where the Penguins play\".

It tasted fresh and creamy! The crabcake...(can I call it that?) was more like a clump of Stove Top Stuffing and a tiny bit of crab meat. The two jumbo fried shrimp were ok.

But  please take a look at my photos and see how small the soup bowl is.  I placed the spoon on top for comparison and you will really see that the bowl is not much bigger than the spoon.

I thought I'd just wander around for Thai lunch and so I ended up at Lemon Grass.  I'll probably not be back.\n\nThere was just one table of 2 seated and eating when I arrived.  And, a table of 10 leaving and all paying separately.  All using a credit card.  I forgot to mention that the one waitress working is also the cashier.  So, it took quite a while to process this table's payments individually by card.  In moments like these, it's best to just get the one check for the whole table and take the 18% auto gratuity as a courtesy to the server.  (Sorry for the rant there...)\n\nAll that said, the huge table of 10 had left.  I was dining alone and there was just the other table of 2 in the restaurant.  I thought I would be able to get in and get out for lunch.  But, no such luck.  It took a while for the server to take my order.  The food came out quickly enough.  But it was quite underwhelming.  I settled with the Thai Fried Rice with beef.  There was a ton of Thai basil in the dish which was quite overwhelming.  I couldn't be sure if the basil was fresh which may be why the dish tasted a bit rancid to me.  My entree also came with a choice of soup and a small vegetarian egg roll.  I chose the hot and sour soup.  The soup was neither hot in temperature or spice but it certainly was sour.\n\nI was a bit surprised considering that there were a whopping 3 diners in the restaurant that it took a while for the check to arrive and to get drink refills.

Some dishes remind me of food fads from the 90's (e.g., the chef seems to have a penchant for meat and fruit pairing).

The bread tasted like a generic supermarket baguette; it was served with olive oil and powdery parm (i.e., from the green can). For appetizers, we ordered the prosciutto and figs as well as the trout and peaches. They were probably the highlight of the meal, but the portions were tiny, and the ingredients were not the best.

Ritter's Diner is directly across the street and I eat there all the time.  In my mind a place can only  get better.  As our party of three walks in we are promptly seated by the manager.  Looking over the menu, we all decide on what we want and order:\n\nFrench Onion\nBuffalo Chicken Medallions \nFish Tacos with salsa and guacamole\nCheeseburger (medium) with apple sauce and potato salad\nSide of Fries\nWater and Iced Tea with Lemon\n\nBread with butter, olive oil infused with pumpkin, and our drinks soon arrive.  ALERT: The tea is flavored.  I really do dislike flavored teas, but I put extra lemon in mine to cover the foul taste and continued on.  The bread was slightly aged as the crust was somewhat hard.  The olive oil was fairly tasteless, but fresh.  I would never use a light olive oil for tasting purposes like Cafe Sam did.  While it was an interesting thought to add pumpkin seeds -- this is the current theme -- they didn't add that much to the oil.  At least the butter was soft rather than frozen.\n\nAs we planned work for the next next day, our Buffalo Chicken Medallions arrived.  They need to remove the \"s\" from Medallions as there was only piece.  In fact, they need to remove \"medallion\" and \"buffalo\" from the name and call it something else.  It was just a piece of chicken breast dredged in Cajun seasoning with a few stray strands of cheese melted on it.  Don't get me wrong, it didn't taste bad; but a better name would have been \"Cajun Chicken Breast\" rather than what they call it now.  As I ate the chicken, the French Onion Soup arrived.  This crock of soup looked exceptionally good.  The cheese on top was browned to the proper point.  I took the spoon and cut in with a voraciousness as I could taste it already.  When I put the first bite in my mouth though, the flavor was flat.  I took another bite and it was the same thing.  This wasn't French Onion soup with layers of flavor, but an onion broth that had some cheap, melted cheese on top.  It didn't taste bad, but anyone could make this soup.\n\nI ate half the soup and passed it on to my friend to finish along with the rest of the chicken breast.  I didn't want to eat too much and then not be able to eat the main course.  \n\nAs my friend finished the soup our entrees arrived.  The cheeseburger was served on a piece of a larger sesame baguette and came well done rather than the requested medium.  I didn't try it due to the fact it was overcooked and had sesame seeds.  I did try the apple sauce and the potato salad, though.  The potato salad was just not tasty.  One bite and I didn't want to take another.  The apple sauce, on the other hand, was quite tasty -- I wouldn't call it apple sauce, though.  It was more along the line of fried apples -- some damn tasty fried apples.\n\nAs I wasn't having any of the cheeseburger, I ate all of the fish tacos.  The tacos arrived presented on a sprinkling of iceberg lettuce.  I would think that they should make it a bed of lettuce or just omit it all together.  I am for the latter over the former as I don't eat iceberg lettuce -- no nutrients, just water.  While the fish didn't have bad flavor, it was a tad overcooked.  When I started to eat the tacos, this wasn't a big deal.  As the fish cooled off, though, they started to get too hard for their own good.  The fish tacos need to be cooked less, especially with the fact that they are using white, flaky fish, which is easily overcooked.  At least the guacamole was fresh and tasted good.\n\nAll in all, this was a lackluster event.  If not for the fried apples, guacamole, and great service this would have been a one-star.  I don't know that I would ever willingly return since I was in sticker shock when our server brought our check.  The price was not commensurate with the quality of the food.  People complain about the quality of the food at Ritter's diner, but the food is actually commensurate to the price that you pay.  When I pay over $20 a person to eat, I expect better than diner fare.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XzaJf6WzpU7RsXTXzx72Xg"}

The hostess was very defensive and said that we shouldn't expect to get sat so soon without a reservation on a Saturday night, so we asked why she told us it would be 10 minutes. She then said that she needed to seat people with reservations before she could seat us and completely refused to acknowledge that she had given us a misleading wait time. I understand that it's hard to guage wait times, but when you're wrong you should simply apologize and not blame the guests for how they planned their evening. \n\nWhen we finally got sat, our server Angel was very good and the Buffalo style salmon steak is delicious. \n\nI really like the food here, but the fact of the matter is their customer service tonight was inexcusable. Even when the customer is wrong, you don't blame them and say \"I'm sorry, but...\" You simply apologize and try to defuse the situation instead of getting defensive and escalating the situation.

We made a reservation for seven of us, but there was no need to call ahead - the place was empty except for a man sitting at the bar, and a couple of girls at another table across the room.  Definitely not hoppin'.  The color of the walls and the decor remind me of a hotel restaurant that only serves a breakfast buffet.  It's very quiet in there, except for the low noises from a TV showing a football game in the next room.\n\nOur server was definitely \"set in her ways,\" as one of my coworkers said.  She had a routine in terms of when she took drink orders, when she took food orders, when she brought the check.  Deviations in the schedule seemed to cause a \"does not compute\" response across her face....like when I sat down and she asked what I wanted to drink.  I said I was going to wait until my next coworker arrived (thinking she might want to share some wine with me), and she was just like \"...you want to wait?  to order something to drink...?\" and I was all \"yes, I just got here....I don't even know what I want!\" and she looked so confused, like how could some idiot like me possibly not know what they wanted to drink - finally she was like \"oh, do you need a list or something?\"  I know, I'm one of those difficult customers who requires a wine list in order to determine what wine I plan to order.  I'm weird like that.  Trying to order food at the same time as drinks was also a no-go.  You have to play by her rules.  When we did figure out the complicated drink-ordering situation, my coworker and I enjoyed our half-carafe of chardonnay.  I'd recommend getting a half carafe - the wine glasses are so small, paying $6 for a glass is a total rip off.  Get a half or full carafe and get your money's worth.\n\nThe entrees come with soup and salad, which seems really old-school and kind of awesome to me.  They had one kind of soup, so you get what you get.  It was a chicken-vegetable-tortellini soup served in a little cup.  I liked it, because I like thin, brothy soups, but it wasn't anything special.  The four little tortellinis floating around were the best part, and it was nice to have some veggies too.  Salad was standard iceberg lettuce, carrot shreds, some tinny-tasting black olives, and the acidic but not-bad strawberry vinaigrette that came on the side.  I didn't bother with the bread - it didn't look like anything special and it just came with butter packets.\n\nI got the pasta roll for my entree.  Despite having lots of ingredients (pasta, spinach, prosciutto, pine nuts, sambuca, tomato cream sauce, probably some cheese somewhere), the dish was surprisingly one note.  I didn't think it was well-seasoned - I ended up pouring red pepper flakes on top to give it a zing, which didn't help terribly.  The texture was good, and it was a cool idea, and it wasn't a BAD dish, but it was just...meh.  Nothing exciting.  Very average.  Pretty bland.  I tasted a few other people's dishes and my response was the same.  It's just generic stuff.  Like I said, Olive Garden, only local.  Considering how \"meh\" the food was, I think it's way overpriced.\n\nSo I wouldn't go back.  It's not my kind of food, or place.  For all the Italian folks around here, I'm sure Pittsburgh must have way better Italian food offerings than this.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nUISXnW2Jo9ovnoFBIUY_Q"}

I moved to Pittsburgh from Seattle where you can find some of the absolute best Vietnamese food.  This place is a hole-in-the-wall with a very brusque owner/waiter and kind of dingy decor.  I don't mind any of these things actually, but the food I definitely took some issue with.  I ordered a tofu-veggie dish (can't remember the name) served over rice.  My boyfriend ordered the pork rice vermicelli bowl.  Our food came fast enough and it was served hot.  However, my dish was nothing to brag about.  It was pretty average tasting Asian fare.  It didn't taste bad by any means, but not restaurant quality.  Good thing it was only about 6 bucks.  My boyfriend's dinner was a real disappointment, however.  My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Seattle had HUGE vermicelli bowls with absolutely fresh lettuce and onions, piled high on top of perfectly cooked noodles.  The meat/tofu you ordered with it was never sparse and it was cooked to perfection.  Everything was doused with some sweet fish sauce and presented with some sliced egg roll.  The pork vermicelli that came to my table did not resemble this at all.  It was served in a rather small bowl with just a few pieces of lettuce and onion.  The \"pork\" that was on top amounted to about 1/4 of a cup of weird texturized, shredded something.  It almost looked like boiled ground beef.  I felt sorry for my boyfriend because he had never eaten Vietnamese food before and I had recommended a vermicelli dish to him because they are (usually) delicious.  As a double whammy, his dish was about 9 dollars!  Neither of us were full when we were done with our meals, so we ordered some spring rolls, which were supposed to be what they are famous for.  I don't understand this either.  The rolls were extremely bland and chewy.  The sauce that was served with it didn't do much to save it.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place and I will continue my search for good Vietnamese food elsewhere.

At Tram's, the pho bowl is small.  I don't expect a huge basin-size bowl, but a bowl of pho needs to have enough noodle, broth, herbs and spiced.  The meat is too overcooked for pho tai (pho with thinly sliced beef steak that is supposed to be cooked only when the boiling hot broth is poured in the bowl).  The taste is reminiscent of pho but isn't quite right.

I will admit that I only tried the pho and a vermicelli bowl (on separate trips), but having ordered anything else on each of my trips would have put my bill in the neighborhood of $12+. Having grown up with cheap Vietnamese food in Texas, I wasn't prepared to spend that much for what's supposed to be a budget lunch, even with the understanding that I was going to leave hungry and that the lack of non-European ethnic diversity in Pittsburgh is going to automatically make things more expensive.\n\nEither way, I don't understand the hype surrounding this place. The pho bowl was small, with a tasteless broth and child-sized portions of noodles and meat. After a few bites, I drenched the whole thing in Sriracha just to give it some flavor and to try to trick my stomach into feeling a bit more like I had eaten something.\n\nThe vermicelli was not so great either--a small portion of vegetables and noodles with a few too-thick chunks of pork that were not grilled long enough for any sort of darkness or crisp (but which still managed to be dry). The color of the dish was as bland as the taste.\n\nAs for the atmosphere, not a big deal for me. The restaurant is small, with minimal seating and some dinginess to it, but that's fairly common for older Vietnamese restaurants. Most diners are young, hip, and not Asian (which could be a turn-off for some due to the perceived lack of authenticity and/or hipsteriness). Parking is a chore; if you live nearby and choose to give the place a try, walk or ride your bike, or prepare to find yourself circling nearby blocks of permit-only parking.\n\nFolks who dine at Tram's should keep in mind that cheaper, better, more authentic Vietnamese food exists out there. I grew up in North Texas (Dallas-Fort Worth area), where with one of the largest Vietnamese populations in the country, good, cheap Vietnamese food can be found all over the metro area. Pho portions down there are reasonably big, there are plenty of different meat combinations, and you can almost always choose the size of the bowl you want (usually kid's, small, large, and extra-large). Additionally, due to the presence of plenty of fresh ingredient suppliers and competition, prices are more in line with portion size, and the food is, more often than not, good. Most folks with normal appetites are able to leave satisfied having spent no more than $7 or $8 a person with tax and tip (compared to $20 at Tram's). Out of all the Vietnamese spots in North Texas that I've tried, my absolute favorite is Pho Pasteur, in Arlington: The pho, vermicelli bowls, crushed rice dishes, spring and egg rolls, and prices are all excellent. Tram's would be put out of business if anyone ever opened a restaurant like that up here.\n\nIf none of the other few choices in Pittsburgh are satisfying your Vietnamese food cravings, it might be worth it to take a weekend trip up to Toronto. You would also have access there to some other Asian foods that we don't have here, such as dim sum and Taiwanese \"small eats.\" For a slightly shorter drive, you can also find these things (though more sparsely) in the D.C. suburbs.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dxCqGkhtXq-9fYEsX7Mf6Q"}

Pamela's has great breakfast, but is in no sense a diner, and there are many good sandwich shops, but once again, they aren't diners.\n\nHaving only been there once so far, my review may be a little skewed. The restaurant has the diner feel, no doubt. There are jukebox machines at every table up front and the decorations harken to the setting of a greasy spoon restaurant.\n\nIt was busy when we went, so the food took a while. The wait seemed longer than it should have been, but as I said, the place was packed and it was exactly lunchtime. On the menu it stated that they used \"premium maple syrup\", but I'm pretty sure I just got corn syrup in a cup. The coffee was somewhat watery but still alright.\n\nI ordered the french toast with eggs and bacon, all of which was rather bland (Except the bacon, a meat which has some inherent godliness to it. You can't mess it up). Basically, it seemed like a meal I could have whipped up lazily on my own, and in less time. The bread for the french toast was plain white toast and I normally prefer a better bread. The eggs were eggs: good without any pizzazz.\n\nWhile Ritters is cheap, from my small sampling, I found the food boring. Most good diners have some excellent menu item, and perhaps I drew the short straw.

Granted I was only 7 or 8 years old then, but I can recall everything (how can I forget the taste of those pancakes?!). Since then, I've been to quite a few diners, including diner-restaurants (i.e. faux diners). I would go particularly on the morning after a night of partying and/or drinking, when I'm feeling too lazy or hung over to cook something decent without burning myself and my kitchen. On these mornings, I would typically order pancakes or omelettes with a side (usually hash browns) and coffee. Honestly, I've never eaten anything other than these breakfast staples at a diner.\n\nMy friends and I arranged to have a late brunch one day at Ritters Diner. Now, I didn't have much to eat the night before, so I couldn't wait until we met to have something to eat. So, I came to the diner having already eaten a light breakfast. A quick observation of the diner made me realize that this isn't a traditional diner; instead, it seemed more like a diner-restaurant. Oh well, there was still the service and the food to worry about. We sat down at a booth in the large room in the back of the restaurant. The waitress greeted us and took our drink orders immediately: two cups of coffee and two glasses of water. Several minutes later, we got our coffee and water, but weren't ready to order just yet. We spent several more minutes deciding, and when we were ready, we placed our menus in a neat stack in the center of the table to show that we were ready to order. We waited...and waited...and waited some more. Minutes turned into half an hour and longer. By that point, my friends were getting quite hangry. I was sitting there feeling sorry for them and very concerned with the poor service. This whole time, I was monitoring discreetly the other diners who had our waitress and arrived after we did. A few of them actually have gotten their food, have paid, and have left. After what seemed like an eternity, our waitress suddenly materializes and takes our order.\n\nWe get our food: chocolate chip pancakes; club sandwich; spinach omelette with cheese and buttered toast; and something else (sorry, I must've had too much coffee). My omelette was decent; I would have preferred if they hadn't used too much cheese, especially what I think was American cheese (it could've been cheddar, but the taste didn't seem right). The toast was good, but I was too full to keep eating. I did try a bite of the chocolate chip pancakes, and it was so rich and delicious! My other two starving friends pretty much inhaled their food in minutes.\n\nBased on this one experience, I would come only for the pancakes. Service was really bad even though the place was half empty. I might experiment with this diner once or twice more to get a better feel for it.\n\nSo to summarize: not a real diner, service was bad, food was decent, and come for the pancakes.", "type": "review", "business_id": "--UE_y6auTgq3FXlvUMkbw"}

When my boyfriend asked our waitress if the food would be coming soon, she again acted extremely annoyed, as if our presence was a nuisance. She told us she did not know when the food would be up because \"Sundays are really busy.\" When the pierogies came we were disappointed to realize that only three came in an order.

No parking = no visit from me.\n- The eggs were pretty good.

Their fries are long and taste good.\n- The breakfast prices are reasonable.\n- They do have a wide variety of options on their menu. They have seafood, burgers, hot dogs, chicken, steak, breakfast food, ice cream and other stuff.\n\nThe bad:\n- It's 2015 and they have no website or menu. Think about that. I have no idea how they could ever find customers not from the local area. They could put up a website for free and a menu as well. It would take less than 1 day of their time. There's restaurants from third world countries that have menu's online.\n- They want $1.75 for cheese on their eggs. I can almost buy a full pack of cheese for that price\n- The fried chicken is so so, but they want $7.70ish for one chicken wing sized leg, a mostly small breast and an even smaller leg. Not worth it at all, since you can get a better deal at Popeye's or KFC, who I both find expensive. Their chicken is better too.\n\nMy friend got an omelet of some sort and seemed to really like it.\n\nWould I return there?

In practice, it's not very pleasant to go there. I don't think they want us there. Every interaction seems designed to make people feel awkward.\n\nThe burger itself  -- the actual cooked meat -- is indeed good, but they have no interest in all the other stuff that turns cooked meat into a hamburger experience.  The buns are poor quality; they absorb juices and toppings so they get sloppy and disgusting after a few bites. The burger just falls apart in your hands (or onto your lap). You have to finish it with a fork.  \n\nThey don't serve French fries, and they seem affronted when you ask for some.  This is a bizarre, given that everything else about the place screams \"we have fries here!\" Why withhold fries from customers who surely have been asking for them every day for years? This hints at either a weird purist dogmatic sensibility, or deliberate sabotage.  Why not serve fries *and* homefries?  Are they afraid the fries will win, exposing the hollow sham that the homefries have been all along?\n\nI've come to believe that everyone at Tessaro's is under a spell where they must cook and serve excellent hamburgers, but they hate cooking and serving hamburgers.

One, I moved here from South Florida, where the best burgers in town came from your average diners.  They were the last bastion of American food in South Florida, so they served up REAL American food.  If you wanted a real burger, you went to a diner.  After returning to Pittsburgh, I found that every diner here has turned to serving up those frozen gray hockey puck patties and passing them off as burgers.\n\nSecond, (until the recent explosion of good burger joints in da burgh), I actually HAD been a fan of Tessaro's, until their hostess/manager flat out offended the hell out of me and my party of three.  The result is that I have never, and WILL never return to Tessaro's.\n\nMy best friend is a 62 y/o blind woman that I met doing theater in the 90's in Pittsburgh.  She lives with her 91 year old mother, and her father (the driver) passed away several years ago.  I don't drive, and rely on the bus system that Steve Bland is intentionally systematically destroying, so any outing that we make must be carefully planned.\n\nShe and I had met once at Tessaro's.  It was her first time being there.  She took the Access van for the disabled, and I met her there after work via bus.  I walked in, she was seated, having a drink, waiting for me to join her. No problem.  We had a great meal, with an awesome burger.  I can't say enough...they really do have mouthwatering burgers.\n\nMonths later, we decided to go again, and the plan was pretty much the same.  She took the Access van to the restaurant, and I was going to meet her by bus, and this time a new friend was going to join us, coming by bus from Oakland, and new to Pittsburgh.\n\nMy best friend called me at 4:30 (we were supposed to meet at 5) and said that her van had come early, and that she was already at the restaurant.  I told her I would get there as soon as I could.  I left work a few minutes before 5 pm, and arrived at the restaurant 5:15.  They were busy, but I was surprised to find my friend still standing in the doorway.  The blind woman had been standing there for 45 minutes.  \n\nI made my presence known, and the hostess/manager acknowledged, asked about our other friend. I explained that he was ten minutes away and coming by bus, new to the city, but WAS on his way.  She walked away from us.  We stood in the doorway fro another twenty minutes.\n\nFinally, the manager came back, and I caught her attention, and motioned my head toward my blind friend, and asked if we really had to keep waiting?  She'd been standing there in the doorway for over an hour.\n\nThe next statement sealed the deal on us never returning to Tessaro's.  The manager slapped her hands on her hips, and started barking:\n\n\"LOOK!  We don't have many rules around here!  In fact, we only have ONE, that you don't get seated until your whole party is here!\"\n\nAnd THIS is what really sealed it:\n\nThe woman thrust her thumb in my BLIND friend's direction, who had only been to Tessaro's ONCE before in her life, with me, and said:\n\n\"And SHE oughta KNOW that!\"\n\nShe oughta know that?  Exactly HOW should she 'know that'? The only other time she'd been there, she arrived before me, was seated, waited, and I joined her.\n\nAdditionally, the 'rule' was posted...on a piece of 8 1/2 by 11 copy paper, taped to the wall at the end of the counter, behind several rows of water pitchers.  I couldn't see the 'rule'...a blind woman certainly wasn't going to 'see' it!\n\nFinally, after another ten minutes standing there, the manager 'allowed' us to take a table and wait for our friend, who came five minutes later.  We ate our meal, paid our bill, and we left.\n\nAnd we will NOT return.\n\nYou can treat me badly, and if there's something I really love about your business, I might come back.  But do NOT badmouth a blind woman, or anyone else for that matter, who is disabled, and in need of a slight amount of extra consideration.\n\nTessaro's, you might make good burgers, and you'll continue making a fortune off them.  And I'm sure you really don't give a crap about how your manager treated this lady.  But we will NOT drop one dime more in your restaurant.  We'll take our business to Burgatory.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vgXE1I7c9ElcfYyZfQiN1Q"}

It's extremely frustrating.\n\nThe time before last we were there we ordered food and the waitress told us that we could expect to wait over an hour bc they had a group of 15 come in.

Plus the pizza was made so poorly that the middle of the pie was paper thin and inedible while the outside of the pie was way too thick and was hard to chew.  Basically what we have here is another bowl-like pizza where all of the ingredients pool into the middle because it was made so poorly.  \n\nIt is pretty clear who is wearing the pants in this pizza, good old Uncle Cheese....and the pants are soaked.  I watched the kid making one of the pies and he just filled up both of his hands with 2 pounds of cheese and tossed it into the middle of the pizza and just kind of scattered it towards the outside and said \"yeah, that will do\".  They are using a really high quality cheese and it does have a great taste and it has that gummy effect that you would get if you ordered extra-cheese.  Unfortunately there is just way way too much of it for the pizza to even be edible in some spots.  You couldn't even pull a slice off of the pie to put it onto your plate without pulling all of the cheese off into a big pile in the middle.  They are using lots and lots of cheese to compensate for how bad the best of the pie sucks.\n\nThe sauce is very forgettable and watery.  They put very little sauce on the pie anyway and its applied with no pride in the traditional lazy bulls-eye pattern where you sauce in some spots and none in others.  The sauce has a bit of a sweet taste, un-offensive and maybe tasty if they were to ever put enough on for anyone to taste it.\n\nIn general this is just lazy pizza where they would rather give you 2 pounds of cheese than actually have to take pride in their food.  I feel my butt hole starting to cry as I near the end of this review, save yourselves the T.P. and just leave this one alone.  \n\nI am giving it a 4 out of 10.", "type": "review", "business_id": "r8jeeS3k_diihMDSu9IjlA"}

Almost every order I've placed had something forgotten or incorrect. There are always crewmembers milling around doing nothing, playing with the TV or in case, rapping behind the counter.\n\n I've just had it with this store, I plan on avoiding it until the get some people actually interested in serving their customers, and I would strongly advise others to do the same.  At this point I wouldn't even trust the food that comes out of their kitchen.\n\nUPDATE:   I was able to reach a regional manager via email, and he replied briefly that it was a situation that was being addressed.

I had thought about eating here in the past but was always put off by the location.  That being said, I went to Il Pizzaiolo last night with my fiance, and I have to say I was very disappointed.  We started with the Caesar salad, which was OK.  The dressing was delicious, however there was very little of it, and we found ourselves eating entire bites of dry, flavorless lettuce.  It was also an outrageous $10 dollars.  Don't get me wrong, had this been an entree sized portion, $10 would have been more than appropriate.  However it was just a starter size, and should have been no more than $6.\n\nWe then shared their margherita pizza which had delicious flavors, but was incredibly soggy.  It was also fairly small, but that was almost to be expected.  It was $12 dollars, so the size was not necessarily a problem, however it was hard to enjoy such a soggy mess of a pizza.  We also shared a pasta dish which was INCREDIBLY overpriced.  At $17 dollars, I was expecting more than a small bowl filled with dry pasta.  It was homemade, and well made, however it was almost insultingly small.  We finished with tiramisu which was excellent, and appropriately priced at $8.\n\nIn all, I found the flavors of their food to be excellent, however i was horribly misled.  Not only was every menu I found online roughly $2 to $3 dollars cheaper than their actual menu, but there was a table next to us who ordered pasta and received an enormous portion, prompting us to order pasta.  It was only till later did we realize that they were employees who had decided to dine their for the evening.  We also had a serious problem with the timing of the food.  The service was great, however for a Tuesday night, I would have thought their kitchen could time the courses properly; we had barely started our salad when the entree's came.  In all, I don't think I will be going back to this restaurant, nor would I recommend anyone waste their time traveling out to Mt.

My date and I were told there was a 30-40 minute wait and after almost leaving, we made our way through the restaurant to wait in the wine bar.  Hmm a bit misleading.  It was quite humid and crowded.  I am patient and was in great company but...there were some negative moments.  On our way up the wine bar stairs,  I held the door as a hostess directed a party down the teeny stairs to their table, only to be squished by patrons coming up who thought I was there for their convenience and more than happy to hold the door as they pushed past.  Also some of  the patrons at the bar seemed displeased that new faces were coming in and did not seem to want to budge to make any room for ordering beverages.  Anyway, I do not drink so I had literally stand still (think sardines) until some people were seated elsewhere.  I was then able to find comfy chairs to sit in.  There were some appetizers sweating and/or floating in olive oil on the windowsill which I found a little gross.  A not-so-polite employee cleaned up the space and extra drink glasses around me.  Giving me a dissatified \"thanks a lot\" look that made me want to justify myself as not being the slob that left the glasses and plates!  But my date returned and relaxed with a glass of wine as we chatted.  We were seated surprisingly promptly.  We were lead to a small two top near the door.  While not ideal, it was do-able.  I had a salad and the pizza with te arugula while my date hads the fpur cheese.  I loved my pizza and besides one of the cheeses my date also enjoyed his pie.  The pizza crust was slightly sweet and baked just right. (Like I said, I really enjoyed mine and the food is why I gave 3 not 2 stars.)  Thankfully my date was able to help me finish my pizza and there was some to take home.  Our waiter was nice and somewhat attentive.  I did have to hunt him down for red pepper flakes, a refill on water and our small table became quite crowed and yet he did not remove the bread basket/plates.  I grew up in Mt.

Lebanon, I went to il Pizzaiolo years ago, but haven't been back in recent memory. I don't remember much about it before, and after my experience there last night, I will remember not to go there again.\n\nWe were celebrating my friend's birthday. We got there about 7:45 with a party of 5, and there were a few tables open. The only table that was large enough to accommodate us, a table for 8, was available in the back. The brunette hostess starts to take us back there, but then the blond hostess says \"we have a large party coming in and they're going to be eating and drinking for a while.\" She points to a small table for 4 and says \"You'll sit there.\" Confused because the restaurant allegedly doesn't take reservations, we offered to wait until one of the 6-person tables opens up. The blond hostess refused. \n\nParagraph in which I rant about the blond hostess: This girl can't be older than 17. The whole time she interacted with us, she was rude, dismissive, and acted like it was a bother for her to be doing her job. She gave us so much attitude, like she was doing us a favor by seating us at all. No wonder people always comment on how bad the service is at this place - if your first impression is with a condescending high schooler who needs an attitude adjustment, it would take a lot to negate that first impression. Also, someone needs to tell this girl that tights are not pants. If I wanted to see someone's a$$ while I ate, I'd go to a strip club. /end rant\n\nWe were seated at the tiny 4-person table, two people on one side of the table (who wants to eat with a corner of the table sticking into their chest, as the hostess arranged the seats?). The 8-person table sat vacant for the first hour we were in the restaurant, and we were almost done with our meal when the allegedly expected party came. Funny how they don't take reservations, yet they would not sit us at the only table available that would accommodate our party.\n\nOur server, Ryan, was great and attentive. I think he realized how pissed off we were at the hostess and put in some extra effort.\n\nAs for the food and drink, it was just fine. Severely overpriced, but fine. Piccolo Forno is much cheaper (and is BYOB) and has much better food. \n\nThere are so many options in downtown Mt.

I went with Turkish Engineer (TE) on a snowy weekend evening. We dined rather early, so there was no wait. Unfortunately throughout the meal, I noticed almost the same (if not more) problems with service and food. \n\nOur drink (two sodas) and appetizer orders were taken almost immediately (great!). But we were not given silverware or napkins and for some reason could not possibly distract our waitress to obtain any. We snagged some from a nearby empty table instead. My soup and TE's frittatine arrived a short time later. The wedding soup was delicious, with savory meatballs, spinach, and orzo. I did ask for some parmesan cheese to put in the soup, and our waitress shook exactly half a teaspoon over the bowl and quickly departed. Since when is parmesan cheese a limited commodity? The way the servers at Il Pizzaiolo protect the freshly grated parm, you'd think it was made of gold flakes. But I digress. The frittatine (fried pasta with bechamel sauce and cheese) was quite bland. After a few bites, we had it wrapped to add tomatoes and herbs at home. \n\nThen our pizzas arrived; I ordered the margherita doc (mozzarella, basil, and tomato sauce)  and TE chose the funghi (mushroom). My pizza, (despite it being short on the basil), was very tasty. TE was upset to find he was served not a pizza with mushrooms, but one with sausage instead. He asked if he had ordered correctly, and I said that he had. Even the patron next to us said that TE had indeed ordered the mushrooms. The waitress seemed a little unnerved but quickly had the kitchen make a new pizza. \n\nOverall, a disappointing dining experience. It took forever to get water and any other items we needed for our meal.  We tried to be patient, as we only saw two servers working. However, there were three hostesses at the bar chatting and seemingly doing nothing. The restaurant was by no means crowded (this was a Sunday). Moreover, what is the point of having three hostesses and two overworked servers? It doesn't make sense. \n\nI will speak up for the quality and freshness of the ingredients. Everything is freshly made, especially the pizzas. That is great. But otherwise, the food and service at Il Pizzaiolo is severely lacking.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA"}

A large cheese pizza (which is 16', or 12 slices for those of you who think that makes a difference) costs a rich neighborhoodly $17.50 (plus the $20 parking ticket which I will take half the blame for...bringing the pizzas total to $27.50).  The kid making the pizza was exactly 12 years old and was a spitting image of Ernie from Billy Madison, I was half expecting him to pee his pants mid pie.  Ernie has a lot to learn about making a pizza and the fact that it was 2 in the afternoon on a Thursday and no one in the kitchen was over the age of 20 makes sense as to why the pizza is so sloppy.  \n\nMineos is making their pizza the traditional way, directly on the brick with no screens.  Ernie smothered the dough in flour to the point that the dough was all white and a bit powdery and it left a residue on your hands.  I can't say that I blame him for that thought because if he didn't use the giant hand full of flour to slide the pie in the oven than he wouldn't have been able to put the 9 pounds of cheese on the pie that Mr. Mineo requires for a pizza to be deemed edible.  The pie still didn't quite make its way into the oven without turning into a wonky oval shape.  The pizza was way too thin in the middle and the gelatinous wad of cheese that enveloped the pie made it pretty much impossible to pull the slices apart from each other.  This is the kind of pizza that you need to eat with a spoon.  You really can't eat it like pizza, you just kind of have to pick the cheese curd off and eat it by itself and then you can eat the crust afterwards.  The pizza was relatively well cooked, it lacked color but probably just because of the excessive flour.  The sauce was spread on fairly well but the cheese was just wadded on with absolutely no regard for my butt hole.\n\nThe dough has that typical bad salty cracker Pittsburgh type taste to it.  The crust has a pretty low hydration rate and is quite dry but you probably won't notice because you will be too busy choking on the grease from the cheese.  The middle of the pie was way too thin and the crust was pretty puffy.  The flavor of the dough is generic and salty.  The dough was also fairly dense.  \n\nThe sauce wasn't bad, I would be curious to try this sauce on a pie that had a sensible amount of cheese.  The flavor is mostly derived from basil, oregano and sugar.  They are definitely using a lot of water in the sauce and adding sugar to offset it.  Its not the worst sugar water sauce I have had in the city but it certainly isn't great.  The tomatoes seem to be decent quality, no real chunks though just a thin even consistency.  \n\nThe cheese ruined this pie.  It tastes like a mix of mozzarella and provolone, quite possibly some cheap stuff blended in with some good stuff.  I don't understand why any pizza shop would want to put so much damn cheese on their pizza when it is by far the most expensive part.  I can't even think of a joke, I just want to take a nap.\n\n\nAll in all this pizza just sucks.  Its sad to me that places like this are the standard for pizza in this city, its just breeding more fat oblivious ranch dressing dunkers.  People don't eat pizza like this because it tastes good, they eat it because it gets you high as fuck and releases all your happy lazy brain molecules so that you can just lard there and continue watching the latest scripted reality tv show.  I am feeling pretty defeated by this pizza, both in brain and bung.  \n\n4/10", "type": "review", "business_id": "sa3xqElJEv97MazozLeszw"}

The wonderful thing about living in a city like Boston is that there are few chain restaurants, but infinite amounts of local-owned restaurants with hip atmosphere and delicious food made with fresh ingredients and a whole lotta passion.  I understand you're hard up, but this place made your list of top 25 restaurants in the city?  Seriously?  The decor looked much like many homes in the suburbs outside your city-a little bit o' this and a little bit o' that, but that is beside the point.  Swarmy waiters you have to flag down for service (and by the way, the locals were having to do it too) is not charming or cool.  It's unacceptable.  Especially when a restaurant has the audacity to charge what this place was for a crappy meal.  And I'm telling you, other than the Thai corn chowder, this food was barely edible.  What with all the Kings and Eat-n-Parks you may not know this, but trust me, a visitor from the land of delicious, this is just gross.  And to pay anywhere over $100 for gross (or even anywhere edging up to $100) is just a slap in the face.  It's time for Pittsburgh to get standards that are above ground.  A restaurant like just should be nowhere near your top 25.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9SPwF-vRgtuHxciFxv5YLA"}

At the end she closed our bill early and said that we should tell her if we need anything else. That was our sign to leave. What a way to ruin an otherwise beautiful evening.

I went for the infamous bacon night this past Tuesday and wow - it sucked. First off, our waitress just wasn't good. She forgot to put our order for a basket of bacon in and we had to ask for it thirty five mins later. Bacon doesn't take that long to cook. Then, we had to ask for ranch with our wings - which we'd already requested, but she'd brought us bleu cheese instead. Oh, AND they were out of bacon wings! On bacon night! WTF. \n\nAnyways, we also had to request sour cream for the pierogies, which is normally brought out with them, plates (b/c we were sharing several appetizers), and ketchup. Why ketchup? Let me tell you. We'd ordered the sliders as well, and it was the saddest display of baby burgers I've ever seen. \n\nThey were brought out on one of the same small plates that we had for sharing our apps - like the size of a saucer that you'd put a tea cup on. And there were only TWO of them. Two! For six bucks I'll go get six non-mini burgers at freaking mcdonalds. And to top it off, they were dry as the sahara and served with NOTHING. \n\nI got the sliders at Harris about six months ago and there were four sliders to an order, and they were served on a fanciful, long plate with a selection of condiments - you know, ketchup, tomato, onion, mustard, etc. Normal things that people put on burgers every day. So, that was really disappointing. But it wasn't over.\n\nThe bacon \"baskets\" arrived. The simple fact that they serve it in a basket seems to imply that there will be a pretty decent amount of bacon in there, right? Nope. There were literally exactly four sad little pieces. The big basket only made 'em look all the sadder. And they'd somehow managed to burn half of each slice black, while the other half was rubbery and undercooked. Yuck. \n\nOverall, I would never go back again if it wasn't for the fact that I have a gift certificate.
