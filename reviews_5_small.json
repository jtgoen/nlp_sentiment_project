My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak's \"25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh\" and he's usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!  Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY.  So come prepared, but I'm pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well.  And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mVHrayjG3uZ_RLHkLj-AMg"}

He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\n\nWell, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\n\nAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\n\nSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. \n\nWe walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'\n\nThis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\n\nOh...but good food counts too. \n\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\n\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\n\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \n\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\n\nEmil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.\n\nYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\n\nAddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mVHrayjG3uZ_RLHkLj-AMg"}

Either way you get 3 nice size pieces of fish equal to a pound.  You can have your choice of sides, but I always get the small mac n cheese for my side.  The staff is always really friendly and service is prompt.  It's in a rough neighborhood, but the Rankin police station is right across the street.  Almost every visit there I have seen police officers inside mingling with the locals or picking up lunch orders.

Don't be put off at first - the outside doesn't have much decoration to speak of and looks like the sort of place that you might think twice about it.  A TGI Fridays it isn't... And thank god for that.\n\nThe place is well-kept but a little dated -  no fripperies here.  But we're not here for the Decor - we're here for some dinner.  \n\nThe menu is basic with reasonable prices.  The meats and seafood are high quality and everything is made to order.  Their stuffed cabbage is regarded as the best in  Pittsburgh.  I love stuffed cabbage but I just made a batch a couple of weeks ago and I'm cabbaged out.  Their Ruebens are   also killer (our waitress raved about them).  My wife and I both settled on fish sandwiches.  These are true Pittsburgh fish Sammiches - fresh fried fish in crispy breading, crammed between enormous pillows of soft, yet chewy and crispy Mancini's Italian bread.  No adornments - just a boatload of hot crispy fish.  Emil's uses thick cod fillets piled high rather than a thin fillet that needs to be broken up to fit in the bun.  Truly a great sandwich.  My daughter had the BLT - looked good and on good bread and they weren't skimpy with the bacon.\n\nThe service was very pleasant and friendly and the crowd was a great group of folks.  We all had fun with 4 other tables when my wife pulled up a Trivial Pursuit game on her iPhone and pretty much everyone joined in and had a good laugh.\n\nOverall, if you consider yourself a true Pittsburgher - you must visit this place.

Well, faithful followers, I must now admit that The Dor-Stop has now been verified as only one of the best.  Why?  That's because Gab and Eat I have now found to be THE best breakfast I've ever had.  If it was closer to my home I would quickly become a regular.\n\nI easily decided to order the Mixed Grill (Half).  Before I go on, I must ask...has anyone seen a full order?  Because I honestly can't imagine how much food that is.  I created my own with bacon, cheese, eggs and potatoes.  Based on reviews I also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if I wanted hot or sweet....or one of each.  I like variety, so I jumped on the change to try both.  I also selected the Italian toast - what other kind is there, really?  \n\nWhen my food arrived, it looked delicious.  There was so much bacon that after eating half of my Mixed Grill it looked like I'd barely started.  The sausage was great, just don't ask me which one I liked best.  My toast?  4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides. It was a struggle, but I was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb.   \n\nIn case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real butter.  I saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  The wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people.  The fact that none of the plates match and I noticed a sign at the front register that said, \"We need mugs\" just makes me love this place even more.\n\nA few tips: 1.) Order the Mixed Grill.  2.) Cash only!  3.) Gab and Eat is a popular place but also very small and narrow (or cozy if you will).  I recommend going during the week when they are still busy but can accomodate a group.  That way you won't feel rushed or crowded.  4.) Get to Gab and Eat ASAP!  You'll be glad you did!", "type": "review", "business_id": "b9WZJp5L1RZr4F1nxclOoQ"}

Lots of it and dirt cheap.  I sat at a vacant stool behind the formica counter and ordered the mixed grill.  Potatoes, eggs, sausage, bacon and Italian toast.  A giant mound of food guaranteed to sooth any hangover.  I swear the full mixed grill had two pounds of food.  Neat thing is that the grill is right in front of you so you can see your potatoes and eggs frying in a pool of fresh grease.  All that food, plus coffee and tip for around ten bucks.

We have to agree with most other reviewers that this is a place to eat.\nWe arrived around noon on Saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables. The place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it. There is plenty of parking.\nInside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time. Country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs & posters. Most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers. We regretted not having a marker to add ours. The other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions - fun way to spend time waiting for food.\nThe waitstaff there is...uh, experienced. They are attentive, pleasant and efficient.\nAfter reading reviews I had to try the Mixed Grill. But S went with pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were outstanding...maybe the best either of us has eaten. They were thick but with light texture and rich flavor. \nHis bacon was cooked just as requested - as crisp as possible - and very flavorful.\nThe Mixed Grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, and spicy Italian sausage grilled together. I'm glad I heeded those who stressed going with the half size order. It filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order. I couldn't finish it all and that's rare. How do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough?\nEverything was cooked well. The sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes. You can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix.\nMy only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain. I like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill. These potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning. Personal preference.\nIt usually comes with Italian toast but they were out so I went with raisin. It was delicious soft inch thick slices.\nCoffee was excellent and the cup stayed full. The total was less than $15. Fabulous value for the quality and portions.\nWhile I can't say it's the best breakfast in Pittsburgh (only here 3 days), its the best so far and one of the best we've had.", "type": "review", "business_id": "b9WZJp5L1RZr4F1nxclOoQ"}

I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us to a great place.\n\nFirst off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.\n\nI am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.  \n\nThe server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.  \n\nWe also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  \n\nBy the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good.  It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  Had I not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly would have finished it.  As it was, I ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.  \n\nOne of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.  \n\nThey had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle.\n\nOverall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  The three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.\n\nMy only complaint is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J's.  I hope work sends me out here again sometime soon!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "P1fJb2WQ1mXoiudj8UE44w"}

The salad was fresh and excellent. Dressing was made fresh and the anchovies were top notch. There is a wide variety of anchovies when it comes to quality and they use excellent ones. There was also plenty of them as usually you get a sparse amount. The large salad was more that enough for my wife and I. They serve a bread basket with two styles of bread. Pepper cheese and a standard Italian with a harder crust. They were both so good I purchased a loaf of each on the way out. Price per loaf was only $4. No way they make profit on the Pepper Cheese Loaf. Best value in bread in quite some time. I will stop in for the bread whenever I am in the area. The Pepper Cheese I would rate a 9.5 out of 10. The Italian was as good as it gets. I am a Pizza snob and getting a good review from me is tough. I am so tough I do not review if I think its bad. There Pizza is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone remotely close to the place. I would ask for a little less sauce. I would call it almost NY Style. Slightly thicker crust.

Everything is good so you can't go wrong and it will most likely come out faster and hotter being that it's on special.  If not I could suggest other delicious things to eat but I don't feel like typing out the entire menu...\nThey often switch the beers out so there is always a constant flow of different and unique craft beers on tap... They can also print you out a list of beers and their percentage so you know what you are in for! (Lol)\nAnyhow I love this place, the owners, and the staff!

Adult games!\n\nThe Homestead (Pittsburgh) location of Dave & Busters is just one of the almost 50 locations across the country - from New York to Florida to California - - from Canada to Mexico.  \n\nThe Dave & Busters idea was conceived in Little Rock, Arkansas back in the 1970s. Two different businesses (one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business) were right next door to each other. The two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense. So they opened the first combined D & B in  . . . . no, not Little Rock, but Dallas! To this day there are no D & B's in Little Rock. Not sure what is up with that! But lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses.\n\nThe one in Pittsburgh is the only one I have ever been to.  When I lived there, a group of friends and co-workers (and me, of course!)used to go there for Happy Hour & Power Hour . . . . at least once a week. We had a blast!  A great place to kick-back and let the worries of the work day melt away.\n\nWonder if they'll ever open one in Marin County, CA? Shucks!  Probably not. Not a Marin County scene, for sure. \n\nWHAT A BLAST IT WAS THOUGH! I miss going to D & B. They have all the classics, like billiards & shuffleboard, plus over 200 interactive & video games. A rechargable Power Card provides an easy way to access all the games.  \n\nPOWER HOUR is game HAPPY HOUR - - an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks.  \n\nA GREAT BAR, WONDERFUL FOOD AND SERVICE! A RELAXING AND FUN WAY to spend a Friday or Saturday evening. You'll never want to leave. Meet your friends here, grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the games. \n\nTime will just evaporate . . . . while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl, your best friend or even your boss!  \n\nDAVE & BUSTERS! LOTS OF PARKING! LOTS OF FUN!\n\nFUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! . . . . BRING ON THE BEER!", "type": "review", "business_id": "sbW8qHJgzEIH42B0S-3New"}

We'd never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food. And we only drink cheap drafts OR drink cocktails during happy hour.\n\nYour visit is largely determined by time of day, expectations and whether or not you eat their food. If you come on a Friday night, the lines will be long. You'll pay $150 for the two of you to eat, drink and play for 3 hours and you'll be left with a very sour taste in your mouth.\n\nThe staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee. \n\nNote the \"drinks are weak\" reviews. Also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person. That's typical white trash behavior. Bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests. All of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because we're courteous and tip well. I have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed, loud guests and address me and take my order first. This is rational, logical behavior. \n\nAlso note the \"prize center games suck\" comments. You're supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize. Like life, delaying gratification nets you bigger returns. Every other visit I've seen someone walk out with a video game system (Wii, Xbox360 and even a few Xbox One's). \n\nThe thing about Dave & Busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day. Sunday afternoon it's all families and Friday and Saturday night it's all drunk 20 somethings. The atmosphere changes and that's why the reviews are all over the place.\n\nThis review is based on 8ish months of 1-3/monthly visits. Most visits are 5 stars, some are 4 stars.\n\nUsing survey receipts for Buy Ten Get Ten, avoiding Wednesday, Friday or Saturday evenings (and Sunday afternoon, families) and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply, you'll have a great experience for $25-40/person.\n\nI really enjoy the staff too, they split the difference between fun and professional.

I don't frequent the restaurant side of RB as much as I do SingSing, but the food comes from RB.

The food is always better over at SingSing for some reason...even if they do come from the same place! \n\nI was craving the Mac 'n Cheese, so I went down to pick some up. I had a gift card, so I figured I wasn't out any money if the food sucked. I saw that there was a new menu, so I sat down to order. I got the Street Food Quesadilla, Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, and Beer Battered Onion Rings. I also ordered a Homemade Root beer and a few samples of the house beer.\n\nEverything was amazing! It came out hot and tasted awesome. They have a new Head Chef and it shows. I was floored...the new Street Food options are fun and tasty. They are unique and different...not something you'd find at any restaurants in the area.\n\nThe Service was good. My waitress was named Liz and she certainly was on point. She even helped me find a beer after I was sorely disappointed by the IPA offering...which was weird. I always thought the House Brews were tasty and fun, no matter their style or make. I'm an IPA girl, but I would happily drink anything that came from their taps. I was disappointed in the offerings, but I ended up settling on the Pale Ale that was quite tasty.\n\nIn the end, if you were turned off by Rock Bottom before, I'd definitely recommend going back to check out the Street Food and new menu offerings.

I needed more. My mother stopped coming home with Uno take out boxes. I stopped eating pizza.

I sat down and ordered the Numero Uno with a side of fries.  \"No not personal...Regular.\" I wanted the entire thing, not just a wedge of a dream. I wanted the whole thing. \n\nIt came out, steaming. Bubbling. Oozing. Fresh. So fresh. I took a bite - the cheese was perfectly melted. And then another - the dough was so thick and tasteful.

They also make sure to clean down the area they prepare the specialty dinner so as to avoid cross-contamination.  I don't know many other restaurants that go this far.\n\nAside from the menu preference, I enjoy my overall experience every time.  Their menu is a bit different than that of what most people will be used to if you regularly eat a Chinese Take-Out or Buffet joints.  Don't expect this to be at all like that.  It's not a Buffet.  They don't sell \"General Tso's\" (though Chang's Spicy Chicken is recommended for those looking for something similar, it's my personal favorite) or other signature foods that you may expect.  They do sell very similar items with different names and a few of their own adjustments, just make sure to read the menu description and ask questions if you are not sure.  They also sell Sake, I believe they have a few different types.  \n\nThe prices can get a bit more expensive than your average Chinese Restaurant depending on what you get but it's well worth it.  Portions are excellent and the taste is great.  I've yet to have one complaint and I have frequented this establishment several times over the span of a few years.\n\nThe only downside, it can be a little crowded and a bit loud.

Everything was great (the street noodles in particular are fantastic), but the service was a bit of a disaster- dishes came out more than 10 minutes apart from each other, a huge mood killer with a big family meal; a few dishes came out dirty; soups didn't come out at all; and our waitress made up excuses and didn't apologize when she had in fact missed some of our orders. We were feeling really ignored and discouraged, until we let Sean know. He took great care of us and went way, way out of his way to make up the experience.

After biking on the river trail that led us to the Waterfront, we zoomed past what looked like a wonderful patio situation at Mitchell's, right on the river. We parked our bikes and were seated promptly at the patio. The waitress even filled our water bottles for us! The interior of the restaurant is very nice, sea-themed, and clean. The decor is really tasteful and classy. The outside was perfect. It was Sunday afternoon and the weather was gorgeous. Looking out to a serene part of the river is fabulous as well. Our waiter was professional, knowledgeable and friendly. We decided just on a few drinks and an app. The two drinks my bf ordered were AMAZING. The first, muddled basil, grapefruit juice and vodka (I forget the name). SO refreshing! the basil was flavorful and tasted awesome with the grapefruit juice. The second he got was a frothy pineapple-vodka with a huge fresh chunk of pineapple inside. Both were winners. I stuck with a fairly priced white wine but got to test his fun drinks :) The app we got was the Hawaiian Seared Ahi Tuna and it was delicious as well. It was a pretty decent size to split, and came with sushi rice, a red onion/cucumber relish, ginger and wasabi. I believe the tuna was also drizzled with ponzu. It was so good - definitely recommend! My bf couldn't help himself so he also ordered a cup of lobster bisque, which I don't eat, but he said it was very good. He also polished off some of the warm bread loaf that accompanied our meal. This place definitely earns the stars and I had no idea it was even a chain. The waiter said they were expanding, so hopefully the quality and service don't go down. I also checked out the rest of the menu and they use quality ingredients and the prices really aren't bad (it was the lunch menu - I'm sure the dinner menu is pricier.) I felt like I was on vacation and I'll definitely be back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "usSROUMiAgPcxV3Ym0OxMQ"}

This is about the only red sauce pizza I ever get a craving for, and boy howdy is it good. The crust is on the thin side and ever so crisp on the bottom, while still having enough dough on the edge to provide a nice chewy bit at the end of your slice. The dough itself is flavorful, not too... well, doughy. The sauce is great, and they don't drown the pizza in it. There's just enough cheese; not so much it's an overwhelming grease slick and not so little you can't tell it's there. If you can go while Mama's working, all the better.\n\nYou can eat in here; they have four or five booths and generations worth of family photos on the walls. Two of us split a small (8-cut) pizza with one topping ($9) and with our two cans of pop we were out for $10. You can't beat that. And I'd put Bellisario's pizza up against any in the city.\n\nI grew up a five minute walk away. My mom loved Bellisario's and I have a lot of fond memories of walking through the alley to pick up a cheese pizza to bring home, my mom being too dollar-conscious to pay for delivery when there were perfectly able-bodied children around to go pick it up. Every time I have a slice, it brings back great memories. But I've had outside confirmation that it really is as awesome as I think it is.\n\nIt's a little divey, stuck in the back of an old shopping plaza, but it's perfect. If you're in West Mifflin (say, going to Kennywood), drive over and eat a pizza. They've also got hoagies and calzones, and I think that's about it.

I decided to explore the McKees Rocks neighborhood and came upon Marge's Place.  I hadn't heard much about this place, but after reading the few reviews I could find, I decided to give it a try.  \n\nInside, it's bigger than I expected but still has that down home diner feel.  My guess is that most of the people there were regulars.  The wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me, someone they had never seen before.  I picked a table in the corner so I could observe what I imagine was a typical Sunday morning.  I ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  Any place that has Mancini's Italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  Being in McKees Rocks, though, they really don't have a choice.  The potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful.  The only way I can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  Is that even a word?  I just don't know how else to descibe it.  The combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price (under $5).  \n\nOne random note: I liked the tables and chairs.  They were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating.  Good distance between the table and chairs.  That may sound silly, and I thought so, too, at first.  But when I go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow, it can hinder my enjoyment.  \n\nNot only will I return, but I will also recommend Marge's Place to anyone in the area.  It was a surprisingly good find.  I like places like neighborhood businesses like this where they make everyone feel like they belong.", "type": "review", "business_id": "r8BwdblCW-ZUES37BL0khw"}

I happen to have a project in the Pittsburgh area and was looking for a Hibachi place to take my co-workers. I read several reviews on other Hibachi places and they all sound the same. The typical they are so busy the service sucks and they rush you in and out to turn tables quickly.  I found Sapporo and was very pleased! It is in an odd location but once you step inside, you feel the ambiance of cozy and family style. My party felt the staff was very friendly.\n\nI had ordered the filet and shrimp with fried rice. The others in my group ordered chicken broccoli, and the Sapporo Deluxe which consists of lobster, filet and shrimp. We all got started with the soup and salads, which was a pretty good size. I didn't want to finish it all because I wanted to save room for dinner. Our Chef was one of the most personable Chef's I have encountered. He was very talkative and really wanted to get to know us. My file was delicious and the fried rice was excellent. They make their fried rice from scratch. It's not prepared ahead of time like I see at most Hibachi places. I can definitely tell the difference. My friend Sam who ordered the chicken broccoli could not stop raving about the sauce that they used. It is unlike soy sauce or teriyaki sauce. We asked the Chef about the sauce and sure enough it is one of a kind. Dan, who ordered the Sapporo Deluxe was very pleased with his meal and couldn't even finish it. Actually we all needed to-go boxes. The portion amount here is incredible. You definitely get your money's worth here!!\n\nI would highly recommend this place to Hibachi lovers because this place is surely a secret in Pittsburgh. I can not stress how different this place is compared to other Hibachi places. I think this restaurant is family owned and not a chain which I can always appreciate. \n\nThank you Sapporo for a great Hibachi experience!! I will be back for sure!\n\nAnh", "type": "review", "business_id": "8Nm_jcCYtMXYW0ODSHDiXA"}

I've found other places that come close, but for me, this is the place I like to spend my money when it comes to hibachi cuisine. \n\nSapporo is an unassuming place right next to Steubenville Pike's hottest tourist attraction, the Pittsburgh Motel. But don't let the location fool you. Step inside and enjoy a cozy atmosphere. There's a bar at the front, some tables to the right, and the main dining area to the left. There's also that karaoke machine I've never seen used in all the years I've gone here.\n\nUnlike other Japanese restaurants like Saga (great stuff) and Ichiban, the cooks at Sapporo aren't all about giving an extensive show while cooking. Each of the chefs have a few of the basic crowd pleasers, such as the knife and spatula toss and the onion volcano, etc., but really it's all about the food, which is fine by me. I do sometimes miss when the chefs toss the pieces of shrimp up in the air towards your mouth to catch, but only because no one ever likes to participate in that but me and it's fun to look like a goofball while trying, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nThe food here is excellent. They've introduced a new look to their menu recently. I don't know if they scaled it down, as I often always order from the same section. I did notice they have a couple of sushi options available. They used to have a full sushi bar, and you can still see that when you walk in, but I'm not sure if they're using it for anything other than just what's on the main menu, which would be a shame if so, as their sushi was always great and you could order it from a separate menu. Again, this may be something they still have that I'm not aware of.\n\nAt any rate, the starter soup and salad is great. I love the bits of onion in the soup. It's a very strong broth, but not overpowering. The ginger dressing on the salad is something you either like or loathe at any Japanese restaurant, and here I really love it, but I tend to like it everywhere I've had it, so I'm not a real stickler when it comes to that.\n\nUsually I order the filet mignon and shrimp with fried rice for my main meal, though last time I got the deluxe version of the dish which also includes lobster tail and ice cream for dessert. Either way, it's a great dish. I've also had the chicken and shrimp and have enjoyed it as well.\n\nNow, my favorite thing here is the shrimp sauce. I call it the \"magic sauce.\" It's of the light pink variety and thin consistency. I'm always disappointed when I go to other Japanese steakhouses and they either don't have shrimp sauce altogether or they have the thicker, mayonnaise-based version, which is OK, but doesn't come close to the awesomeness that is the magic sauce. Apparently it's a secret as to just what goes into it. On one visit our chef joked that its main base was strawberry Quik, which one of the fellow diners at my table believed.\n\nSo if you get the fried rice here, dump some of the magic sauce on there. It's amazing. Use it for your steak or chicken as well. I find myself doing that and then saving the darker sauce for my grilled veggies, which are also top notch here. Terrific grilled onions and ripe zucchini as well as mushrooms and broccoli. I don't care for broccoli personally, but the rest is excellent.\n\nSapporo has also started throwing in noodles to the mix. According to the owner this is because other restaurants started doing it, so patrons who came in started asking why Sapporo didn't have them as well. I think they were doing fine without them, as it just adds even more to an already large amount of food, but they are good, if unnecessary.\n\nThe steak here is great. I've had the sirloin as well as the filet. I always get mine cooked rare, and it is of the melt in your mouth caliber. The shrimp never taste fishy, and the lobster tail is similarly excellent. All around, you get a great meal here for the price.\n\nI'm not sure which nights are more crowded than not anymore. Sapporo's a funny place in that some weeknights you'll drive by and it's packed and then other nights it will be quiet. I'd suppose weekends draw the biggest crowds. Yet even when it was \"packed\" I've never had to wait long to be seated at a table.\n\nSo if you haven't been, give Sapporo a try. It's been there forever. The owner and staff are super nice and they really do care about serving you great food when you visit. They don't do lunches anymore, so it's strictly dinner meals, so be looking at spending at least 20-30 dollars on up for adults, and around 10 or so for kids' meals. It's not some place you would go frequently if you're on a budget, but that makes it all the more a treat when you do go.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8Nm_jcCYtMXYW0ODSHDiXA"}

The owner's son brought us menus to look over and informed us that Sapporo is a family-run establishment. The table quickly filled with regulars who said that Sapporo was their favorite Hibachi restaurant in Pittsburgh, one couple even said that they come for dinner every single Saturday evening. The owner himself came over to our table and began cooking our meal!\n\nI ordered the Hibachi chicken and broccoli in Sapporo special sauce and my boyfriend ordered the Hibachi shrimp and chicken, both with fried rice. Both meals were good but the special sauce on my chicken was absolutely delicious! Definitely one of the best Hibachi chicken variation that I have tasted and my boyfriend really enjoyed how flavorful his shrimp tasted.

This, I must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of, \"There's nothing *in* Pittsburgh, why would anyone go there?\" \n\nTazza D'oro is the answer to that question. Especially if you like coffee. This is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the Mississippi, and I've been to a lot of them. So, what's so good about it?\n\nLet's go in order of importance:\n\nCoffee - It is really, really good. They use Batdorf and Bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in Olympia. Believe me when I tell you that B&B is good. It's not amazingly great, but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously. When I go to a new coffee place I suspect might be good I always get a latte. Why? This one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. I got a latte. They have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one I got. It was fantastic. They did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is). The baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema. \n\nThe coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold, smooth and rich, which it almost never does and this place had it down) I had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. It has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality. It was always superior. \n\nThis is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone, but there was more. \n\nPastries - They all looked amazing. I had a plain donut while I waited in line. Normally I don't eat plain donuts, because life is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. Everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries were.\n\nAtmosphere - This place has it exactly right. It's a mom & pop feel, nothing forced. Some tables, outdoor seating, maybe some local art, but not in a goofy sort of way. Very friendly employees. Just a complete home run. \n\nObviously I loved it. Behind me in line for my re-up, I heard a girl behind me in line complain, \"we could just go to Starbucks, it's cheaper!\" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk. That's fine. Everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad coffee (Starbucks only being guilty of mediocre, though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years, I don't blame people for being set that way. But the beautiful thing about Tazza D'Oro (cup of gold in Italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on Halloween.\n\nTazza D'Oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to Pittsburgh.", "type": "review", "business_id": "83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA"}

The dark wood inside comforts me. The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. \n\nTazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), provides Enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs I've ever met (amazing). Everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do. \n\nThey have a small menu of local/fresh food that looks amazing, but I have never actually eaten it. The espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at Batdorf and Bronson locations in Olympia, WA. I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended - \"we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different.\" Sorry, Tazza D'oro, you are better. \n\nThe lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. There's a sense of community nestled here, just off the \"main drag\" of Highland Park, between Bryant st. and the reservoir. This is where you can pick up your CSA shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day.

Tazza D'Oro is one of them. I wont say THE best simply because coffee is such an objective taste but you cannot deny the expertise and care Tazza D'Oro subscribes to. It brings them millions of miles above Starbucks and (gasp) Crazy Mocha.\n\nI found out about Tazza D'Oro while browsing the blog of an award winning, internationally recognized barista. He conveniently mapped out his favorite coffee houses around the US via Google Maps. I clicked on PA and zoomed it, not even expecting to see a marker. Surprisingly there was -- only one -- and it was for Tazza D'Oro.\n\nTheir baristas know how to make the perfect espresso. Once you've done that all of your other drinks fall right into place. They also do french pressed coffee which is a rare treat usually enjoyed at home and, at least in my case, not done nearly as well as it should be. Their pastries and baked goods come straight from one of the 'burgh's best bakeries -- Enrico's in the Strip District; what more could you ask for?\n\nI have a longer article on Tazza D'Oro as well as another great coffee shop, Espresso a Mano on my website. http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2011/02/11/coffee-pittsburgh-part-2/", "type": "review", "business_id": "83_p9vIqOq1TUIf3_GD7bA"}

For review #100, a 5 star review for a 5 star restaurant is definitely fitting.\n\nCasbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but brunch is my favorite meal and also what they do best.  I ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22.  I started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink.  My companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh orange juice.\n\nWhile waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist mini-muffins, scones, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter.\n\nThe smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake.  There was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon.  I tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor.\n\nMy entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled  sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs.  I love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts.  The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich.  The best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit.  This dish itself is enough to make me a regular.  I tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (I think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too.\n\nService was good, ambiance was good, portions were big, quality was excellent, AND they take reservations.  Sometimes I don't mind waiting the half hour it takes to get seats at some restaurants (Point Brugge, Coca Cafe, etc.), but most times I'd rather spend time with people in the restaurant at a table rather than waiting outside, especially now with winter approaching.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}

I think Eleven is my favorite, but Casbah is a very close second. \n\nMy most recent trip was with my wife on 1/15/10. We started with the grilled flat bread and the butternut squash ravioli. For entrees, I had the Casbah twice cut pork chop and my wife had a pasta dish with sausage and ricotta. For dessert, I had the creme brulee and my wife had the espresso ice cream / cookie (it was really just a fancy chipwich). \n\nThe grilled flat bread came with three different dips, Humus, Red Pepper Hummus, and Baba Ganoush. I really enjoyed all three, but thought the Red Pepper Hummus stood out as the best, although if you're not a fan of garlic you may disagree. The butternut squash ravioli didn't impress me much, but my wife really liked it. \n\nAs far as the entrees, we both really enjoyed our meals. My pork chop was cooked perfectly, and was anything but dry. The sage aioli that it was topped with added an excellent flavor. The sides were kale, and butternut squash risotto, both of which really shined. I can't describe how amazing the risotto was, and the kale was extremely flavorful. \n\nI tried my wife's pasta dish, and overall I thought it was good, but the sausage was really outstanding. Incredibly tender and flavorful. \n\nNeither of us were too impressed with our desserts. The creme brulee was very good, but at that point, I expected it to be great. My wife's dessert sort of disappointed, since the cookies were dry. \n\nThe bill for everything listed above, plus a bottle of red wine (~$35) was $120 before tip, so it is pricey, but in my opinion totally worth it. \n\nAlso, our server was very attentive and helpful, without being intrusive.

Once a month they do a private dinner for a charity - for $100 there is a five course meal with wine flights.

I had low expectations for dessert - it was a cornbread cake (weird!) but came with a blueberry compote and cream cheese ice cream.  The cornbread cake was an excellent balance between the sweetness of the ice cream and blue berries.  It was amazing!\n\nWhile I don't believe these are regular menu items, I highlight this because this was their charity dinner.  That they made NO money off of.

It had been a couple of years since I had last been to Casbah and while I remembered it being decent, it differed a bit from my fiance's opinion that this was the best of the Big Burrito restaurants.  Due to that it had been on my list of restaurants to visit so that I could get a better opinion of it.  The restaurant looked the same that I remembered it with a large outdoor seating area and a smaller one inside with the bar on one side of the restaurant and the dining room on the other.  It was all nicely and tastefully decorated.\n\nI arrived shortly after 5 PM and immediately made my way into the bar area of the restaurant as I hate taking up a table if I am eating by myself.  There was no one else at the bar at this point and the bartender quickly greeted me and gave me a happy hour menu while explaining it to me.  I had not been planning on getting a drink but one of the $6 cocktails caught my eye and I ended up ordering it.  The bartender was pretty friendly guy and explained how he came up with the drink while he made the drink and we chatted for a bit.  For my entr\u00e9e I decided to order the Long Island Duck which was a roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, rosemary, black mission figs and duck jus.  Whenever I had ordered it I had actually missed the fact that it came with a braised leg and was excited to see that extra unexpected portion of meat on my plate whenever it was delivered to me.  The whole meal ended up being incredibly tasty with the duck breast being cooked perfectly with nice seasoning and not greasy at all.  This was in stark contrast to the leg which was incredibly juicy and greasy which I absolutely loved.  Normally I am not a fan of greasier duck but the two preparations really helped to enhance the other.  Finally the figs provided a nice touch of sweetness while the gnocchi was pillow like and tasty.  It was also nice to be able to taste a hint of rosemary on them which I had forgotten about between the time I had ordered and when it was delivered.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  Both my cocktail and my meal were really good and I would actually consider this to be one of the best meals that I have eaten in a little while.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}

The HH drinks change seasonally but you can always get your choice liquor mixed drinks also.  For $6/drink you can't beat it!\n\nWe typically always get the hummus trio as an appetizer with extra pita bread, or the calamari.  All of the entrees we have had (pork belly, risotto, pork chop) have been perfectly prepared, zero complaints.  It's on a pricey side, so not a weekly dinner option for us (unlike the HH!)\n\nI would say the complimentary valet is a perk, but we live within walking distance so haven't used it.  \n\nTIP:  Go to HH on Fridays, ask for Juan, get a Manhattan.

Even better, they went ahead and applied the discount even though we managed to forget to bring the actual card they had sent ahead to us. We had been completely prepared when asking about this to potentially not be able to use that $30 off at our visit, so their understanding alone would have gone a long way in making the meal a good one.\n\nThe amazing food just sealed the deal. Between a table of four we all had the chance to order and then a variety of Casbah's current menu - including their scallops, arugula salad, duck, pork and veal meatballs, and a ricotta very similar to what I had ordered the last time I visited. Everything was stupendously delicious - I honestly have no other words for how good this food was - and we all left full and satisfied with no complaints.\n\nCasbah has definitely become a restaurant that I can come to for special events. Their food and service impressed me again tonight even more than they did last time; add in the fact that they use local ingredients whenever possible and always have something new to try with the changing seasons, and I'm completely sold.

I was torn between Casbah and Eleven, but upon perusing the menus, reading reviews, and giving the matter much thought, I settled on Casbah.  I knew I'd made a good decision when I invited some friends to join me, and they said that, based on their past experience, I'd made an excellent choice!\n\nOur meal started off with a few slices of bread, which came with butter and a Greek yogurt spread.  The butter was good, but the yogurt spread was amazing, and both of them dressed up the bread very well.  We then ordered an appetizer of the bruschetta, which was not your normal bruschetta, but was delicious.  I'm not entirely sure of the ingredients, since what we received doesn't match the menu description posted on the website, but one notable thing about it was that it had some pomegranate seeds that gave it a subtle sweetness and juiciness, complementing the other savory ingredients.  For my entree, I ordered the orecchiette, a dish consisting of ear-shaped pasta tossed in a goat cheese and sage cream sauce, with chicken and dried cranberries.  Flavorwise, this was one of the most well-balanced dishes I've ever eaten, with the savory ingredients and sweet hints from the cranberries (which were actual cranberries, rather than craisins, as I'd imagined) melding together in perfect culinary harmony.  The pasta was also cooked to a perfect al dente firmness, which held up well in the microwave several days later when I ate the leftovers.  The cranberry-lime dry soda that I ordered to go with this entree complemented it very nicely, and was a great alternative to wine (while I was tempted, I didn't order any since my dining companions decided not to, due to having driven).\n\nMy two dining companions ordered the Scottish salmon and the gnocchi, respectively.  Based on the samples that they provided me, Casbah did a great job on these dishes, as well!  The salmon had a subtle saltiness that complemented the flavor nicely, without overpowering it.  My friend who ordered it had had it before at Casbah, but had since been to Scotland, and he said that it was very similar in quality and taste to the versions of this dish that he'd tried there.  The gnocchi was one of the most unique and varied dishes I've encountered, and, based on the two bites that I tried, brought the ingredients together in a medley of flavors and textures.  I think my friend who ordered it described it best by saying that every bite was a bit different, but that they were all delicious!  Although all of us tried bites of each other's dishes, we each liked our own choice best, so we chose well.\n\nAfter our entrees, we decided to order dessert.  Although I was tempted by the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, since many reviewers speak highly of it, I decided to follow my instinct and get the chocolate-hazelnut bomba.  I'm so glad that I did, since this dessert was amazing!  If you like dark chocolatey, torte-like desserts or Nutella, this dessert is a must-try. Since I mentioned I was at Casbah for a birthday dinner, the dessert was served with \"Happy birthday\" written on the plate in chocolate icing, which was a nice touch.  My dining partners ordered the creme brulee to split between themselves, which came topped with an apple compote.  Based on the bite that I tried, it was a good rendition of a brulee, but couldn't match the star power of the chocolate bomba.\n\nWe visited at 7:30pm last Sun., at the later end of their serving hours, but service from our waiter, Brian, was very good.  We were seated in the tent-like area in the front of the restaurant, which stayed surprisingly warm during most of our visit.  At one point before dessert, upon returning from the restroom, I noticed that it'd cooled off, but the manager came out to turn on the heating elements, and it warmed back up in less than 10 min.\n\nIn sum, if you're looking for a solid fine dining experience with innovative, delicious food, Casbah is a great choice.  The food was impressive in its quality, and the service was what I've come to expect at a higher-end restaurant.  I'd particularly recommend getting on the Big Burrito mailing list to receive a $30 birthday voucher and $10 off coupons for the holidays, and taking advantage of one of these occasions to try it.  I'm certain that you'll be as pleased with your experience there as me and my dining partners!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}

We had no room for dessert on this visit, but any of their desserts that have the Meyer lemons is always a hit and I am a die-hard chocolate fan and I will forgo chocolate for one of their delicious meyer lemon dessert creations.  I haven't been to Casbah for brunch in quite some time, but after having gone to Eleven recently for brunch, I'm keen to try Casbah for brunch again soon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}

It's 5 min walk from my home to Casbah and now we're finally here. The place looks really Greekish and I like the fake candle on the table :) Our waitress is really nice and friendly and seems to have a brightening personality, which is enjoyable. We ordered a bottle Project Paso and it goes perfectly well w the entree. For apps, we had sheep's milk gnudi. It is super tasty and I like the lobster and the lemon sauce together. We had the famous pork chop and the Long Island duck for entree. Both are really good. The duck has the fatty juicy leg separated from the thin nice part, which is really thoughtful and help boost the flavor. The pork is not bad either. But the texture of the meat is a little too dry for my liking. If not for the sauce and the braised kale, the dish would be disappointing. Then came out desserts: the vanilla bean creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the chocolate de creme. Omg I can't even find a word to describe how good they are! The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is so much better than the one I had in Joseph Temberllini. I am totally blown away by the rich taste of vanilla and eggs. The chocolate de creme is perfect, too. The texture is between ice creme and fudge, really nice and smooth. My friend said that she could have another two of this.

Being that it is a little out of my price range normally, I figured it was the best place to use my coupon and celebrate my birthday! Believe it or not, this was the 2nd Big Burrito restaurant that I have ever been to, Kaya being my first (and I only visited the Sunday prior to coming here on Friday). \n\nMy boyfriend and I made reservations for 6:30 pm on a Friday. We only made them the night before and it wasn't a problem at all. When you arrive, there is complimentary valet parking- how awesome is that? We were sat on the covered patio area, which I really loved. It was a little slanted, which was weird, but our table wasn't thankfully. It was really beautiful- plants and art all around. We started off with drinks- I ordered the white wine flight. Having had a wine flight one other time, I found these to be pretty reasonably priced. I received three small glasses of white wine for $11. Each one was delicious and I really loved how they were all from different places (Austria, Italy and Spain). \n\nNext, we received bread and two types of butter. One was more traditional and the other was a homemade lemon and herb butter. I really liked them both! For my entr\u00e9e, I ordered the pork chop. It came with a magical mix of sauces and two side dishes- one that was mainly potatoes and the other being saut\u00e9ed kale. WOW. The garlic cream sauce was unbelievable, the pork chop was HUGE and literally cooked to perfection. The kale was perfect, not bitter at ALL (how do they do that?)- it was amazing. The portion was huge and I somehow engulfed the entire thing. My boyfriend ordered the short rib ravioli's and loved it- although he preferred my meal over his. I was so full that I skipped the desert. They noticed my birthday coupon and presented me with an adorable little plate with \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate and two salted caramels- what an adorable touch! \n\nService was perfect, the wine was perfect, the food was perfect... now I see what the fuss is all about. This might be one of my new \"special occasion\" spots-  and we are planning to come back next month for my boyfriend's birthday (I need that pork chop in my life again, stat!).", "type": "review", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}

Meals and service are deliciously consistent, yet there's enough experimentation to keep things interesting.

The bartender was quick to dig out the recipe box and whip one up to sweet and sour perfection. Happy hour prices make a stop at this bar one Shadyside's best options for higher end post-work cocktails. \n\nSeated in the bright (though slightly stuffy patio), we began with Casbah's exceptional calamari. Lightly breaded and fried, the squid was tender and deliciously sauced with a garlicky aioli and the sweet and sour Italian agrodolce (ahhhmazzzing), the combination made for a crave-worthy bite. \n\nPastafest provided tasting portions of some old favorites and chef's creations. We shared three: \n\nGemelli, jumbo lump crab, sweet corn, guanciale, tarragon: sweet and bright, this dish was summer on a plate.  \n\nDoppio Ravioli, eggplant puree, goat cheese, sweet & spicy peppers, marinated fennel: creamy and rich, the sweet and spicy pepper sauce was just the acidic kick the ravoli needed to balance perfectly.  \n\nSheep's Milk Gnudi, pork rag\u00f4ut, baby kale, grilled scallions, orange sea salt, extra virgin olive oil: gnudi is an all-time favorite and the pork ragout was incredibly tender, a gussied up version of BBQ and pasta salad.\n\nWe ended our meal with the milk cake which was moist and sweet and lovely with the last few sips of wine.

My last experience at Casbah was excellent (minus the dining partner but that's another story) so I suggested dining there for this occasion and, since he is not from the area, he trusted my judgment (and my Yelp elite status lol) to choose a great restaurant. I actually made reservations for 8:15pm this past Saturday while I was on the way back from my vacation. Personally, I was quite surprised there was still same day dining availability, but of course I didn't question it. We arrived right on time and used the complimentary valet (get your ticket validated before exiting the restaurant) which was great, particularly since it was raining. We were seated inside and normally I would have rather dined outside but due to the rain, I actually appreciated the inside spot. \n\nI began with a glass of Malbec (my new favorite go-to wine) and my bf had a Cab. We were brought bread which came with regular butter and another seasoned spread which was more flavorful. The bread was fresh and warm, much appreciated since we were both famished. We started off with a cheese tasting and chose the Jasper Hill \"Harbison\"; Vermont, cow's milk, soft; the Sardinia \"Calcagno\"; Italy, sheep's milk, hard; and the Misty Creek Goat Dairy Leon \"Leonora\"; Spain, goat's milk, soft. The tasting was accompanied by bread (I believe the same we were first served upon sitting down) and three spreads-a mustard, a fig spread, and an additional sweet spread, pinkish in color-possibly pomegranite spread. We both LOVED the tasting and all of the cheeses paired excellently with our red wine! We easily cleared the cheese board. For entrees, my bf had the Ricotta Cavatelli( house-made fennel sausage, spinach, crushed tomatoes, ricotta) and I had the Orecchiette (grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream). He devoured his pasta, however, I was able to sneak a small bite for it was entirely consumed and it was quite tasty! The sausage had a bit of spice to it that was very flavorful. I absolutely loved the orecchiette! The savoriness of the goat cheese compounded with the sweet tartness of the cranberries was heaven in my mouth! The chicken itself was quite flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly, not too firm yet not too soft. Another testament to the greatness of this dish is that my leftovers, heated in the microwave the following day, tasted just as good as the meal did when dining at Casbah! Unfortunately, we were stuffed to the brim and too full for dessert, which will be on the agenda for our next dining experience here. The only criticism I had this go-around was the service. We had a male server who was just not personable, unlike the last time I dined here and the server hit the ball out of the park with her friendliness, multiple suggestions and explanations, and knowledge of the menu. This server never introduced himself, mumbled and talked so quietly it was difficult to hear him, and rarely checked on us. My wine glass sat empty for quite some time before he came around and I had to ask him for a glass as he didn't offer if I'd like another. The main reason for dining out is the food, which was incredibly delicious so I will return, however, I hope next visit the service can match or exceed that of my first visit here since that exceptional service contributed to my wanting to return here again and this particular service made me feel quite undervalued as a customer.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}

In addition, the patio is a nice romantic backdrop with overhanging lights and white curtains.\n\nFirst let me talk about the drinks. My husband's moscow mule was a little stronger than most places would make it, but they do have the copper mugs. Some places cheap out on that but not Casbah. I had a delicious house Malbec but then switched over to a Grenache and Carignan blend. It was the first time I've had such a mix and I was so happy with my choice that I ended up ordering another glass. It was a wonderfully rich and bold (but not bitter) combination that was a superb pairing to our dinner entrees.\n\nFor starters I had the octopus, which was ok but not great. There was too much of a char flavor so it was almost burnt. The tuna however was an explosion of flavor. It was fresh and very flavorful.\n\nFor my main dish, I had the duck. I double checked with the waitress when I ordered to make sure the skin was crispy and it was indeed. The meat was perfectly tender and the sauce was sweet and savory.\n\nEveryone at the table thoroughly enjoyed their meals. The lamb shank is so large you need to get a takeaway bag. \n\nThe birthday boy's wife arranged for an ice cream before we got to dinner.

Those two facts have nothing to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year, when my friends and I would stay in our studios all night working, haul ass out to Quiet Storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee, and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class.  And then usually I'd take a three-hour nap after the first class.  But I'm sorry, what is it I'm reviewing here?\n\nThe Quiet Storm has absolutely the best tofu scramble I've ever had.  I'm an accomplished vegan eater (I get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out of ten), I've had the best scrambles New York and San Francisco have to offer.  Believe you me, Quiet Storm tops them all.  I wish I knew their secret recipe, but the part I do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous difference.  Come in on a lazy Sunday morning, get the Nothin' Fancy, and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be.  On top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes.

But generally, the crowd is mellow, reading, chatting, just enjoying.\n\nThe menu is designed in a way that they have something for everyone (except those adverse to eating healthy :). Between the veg and vegan options, they manage to have a menu that is fairly celiac friendly too, not an easy thing to do!\n\nA lot of the reviews here are about breakfast, which is amazing. But my favorite are their dinner salads. They're protein heavy, with a huge variety of ingredients, not your typical salads. And their specials, like tofu curry, are amazing, and always enough food for two.\n\nOh, and the drink menu! I'm pretty much a water, coffee, beer kind of person, so I haven't tried too much on it. But everything looks amazing. Quiet Storm is one of those places that doesn't do a wide variety of things, but what they do, they do damn well!", "type": "review", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g"}

I am not a coffee expert but i really enjoyed my several cups of decaf.  Anyhoo, to the food.  This place is vegetarian only.   I started with a Hummus plate, unlike most creamy hummuses this hummus was gritty as i could actually taste the chick peas with each bite.  The hummus was surrounded by fresh crisp cucumbers, carrots, celery, calamata olives (big fan) and pita. Perfect starter.  For my main entree i ordered the curry special.  Do not expect an Indian food experience but this will not disappoint.   Everything was in the bowl, chick peas, basmanti rice, carrots, and other miscellaneous items.

It's a little out of the way, but once we got there, it's exactly the kind of place I want to live close to. It's spacious and relaxed; we sat there for two hours after eating our lunch and were not at all pressured to move on. It had a very good neighborhood vibe, and everyone working there knew the place and the area really well.\nThe drink options were pretty great- the coffee was just fine, but the ginger lemonade I ordered a couple hours after lunch was phenomenal. I wish I could have that more often. The food was great; there are lots of options and the portion sizes were exactly what I wanted. I had the Dagwood sandwich, which was a perfect mix of sweet, sour, and spicy with hummus, apples, hot peppers, cucumbers, and pickles... it came with an option of the side, and I had to try the mockamole. A big fan of guacamole myself, I was totally in doubt of a green pea-based mock version. I also really like peas, though, so I was open. And somehow they managed to make it work, and it really did taste very much like guac, with a slightly less heavy and maybe a bit grainier texture. But definitely worth a try. My friend had a wrap with curry and tofu and I honestly don't remember what else, but it was huge and really tasty. She chose the potato salad as her side, and it was the perfect imitation of German potato salad, so I was pretty happy. \nAll in all, if you're in Pittsburgh and feel a little lost... go to Zenith and Quiet Storm, and you will feel found.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g"}

The food: The menu was quite extensive...hoagies, soups, pasta, salads, etc. They also have stuff for kids like grilled cheese.

I think it's as good as you can get for vegan cuisine. The country burrito is BOMB! So good, there has to be crack in the gravy. I also enjoy the tahini queso, I often add it to my burrito.

It's a vegan dream come true. It does get a little crowded during Saturday mornings so expect a wait, but completely worth it. The atmosphere is oozing with hipster ambiance associated with the area (Garfield) which also means they often play good music! Last time I was there it was all Neil Young!

Looking through the menu here I actually got excited, because I didn't have to ask \"does this have meat in it\" a million times. THERE WERE SO MANY CHOICES! I have the excitement of the little girl on Despicable Me \"It's So FLUFFYYYY!\" \n\nMy excitement aside, the menu was pretty large for all veg food. They have breakfast all day, which is always ok with me. Prices were average (~8.50), and portions were large enough to provide lunch for the next day. (Although I have heard that the Cuban Sandwich is on the small side).\n\nI had the Banh Mi, which was fabulous. The bread was fresh, aioli was nice, vegs were pickled just right, but the tofu was a little on the dry side (on next day lunch reheat it was perfect). I was surprised by the veg seisage. It was really good. \n\nGazpacho was nice, although I am not really a fan of cold soup. It reminded me of a smoother salsa. Good, but just not my thing.\n\nSarah S. had the special, home fries with chili and cheese.  This was on the spicy side (a good thing) and came with tortilla chips. She was happy with it. \n\nLatte's are good too.\n\nAll in all this was a good experience! I think this is my new favorite place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g"}

We had the \"tenders\" appetizer, with both the vegan BBQ sauce and the vegan wasabi mayonnaise. We much preferred the BBQ sauce, but I am guessing if you are a wasabi fan, you would like that too. We all thought it was wonderful. On the advice of the server, I had the peanut wrap. It was spicy, heavily peanut-flavored, but full of yummy veggies. I also had a side of chili, that I liked a lot (and I make my own veggie chili at home, so I am picky). Ben had the apple panini with the gazpacho side. We both thought the gazpacho was kind of plain (it got better by adding chili!), but the apple panini (with \"seisage\", cheese, etc.) was very good. Finally, Panchu had the coconut burrito, which was huge, but he ate the whole thing, and was very happy.

The buildings surrounding Quiet Storm are often painted with cute art or have little interesting things about them. I love this neighborhood, but I love Quiet Storm even more! \n\nI've only been here twice, and I always want to go more often but somehow it doesn't happen. I've turned on three of my friends to Quiet Storm too, and they love it just as much. The first time I visited I ordered a tofu hash. It was an amazing blend of seasonal vegetables, including some I would never eat otherwise. The tofu was nice and firm, the seisage was spicy and perfectly chewy. The vegan \"cheese\" sauce was also rich and delicious.  The portion was so huge, I couldn't finish it. Leftovers are rarely as good as when the meal is fresh, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that my leftovers were even BETTER than the fresh meal. I think this is because the spices and vegetables had more time to meld together in a perfect veggie harmony. \n\nThe second time I visited was 4/21/2013. A group of my friends came here for Brunch. Two of us ordered the Vegan Country Burrito, another friend ordered the french toast with pistachio honey topping and my other friend ordered a tofu hash with black beans and salsa. Everything was generously portioned, but some meal choices were sold out. They were a bit disappointed that there was no more falafel. All of us devoured our plates and happily chattered about the complexity of flavor, protein content in vegan food items and how much we loved the atmosphere. \n\nQuiet Storm is a great little place to visit. It's never lacking in interesting things to look at while you eat. Food comes as quickly as possible. There are plenty of options to please everyone, and if you think you don't like vegetables, try one of their plates and you may change your mind. (Seriously, I am one of those vegans who hates veggies, but Quiet Storm food can get me to finish all of mine) \n\nTip: If you want to go for Sunday brunch, go early so your favorites will still be available. \n\nYou may also want to nudge the servers a little more than you usually would, because even though our drinks were bottomless, it was a pain to get them back to give us refills - even for water.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PzG0XmAmtXFs6Fdnubf41g"}

We decided to go check it out and instantly fell in love. Their produce selection is second-to-none, seriously. And yes, I am including Giant Eagle in that!\n\nSeriously, just about every time we've gone all the produce looks so fresh and brightly colored (i.e., the peppers, tomatoes, fruits, etc.) and ripe. I also like how they carry pasta noodles, rice, and other fun things in bulk. We always lament about how since there's only the two of us, we don't always need the large offerings that you usually find at places like Giant Eagle. Being able to pick out just the amount you need and not letting anything go to waste makes me feel a lot better.\n\nBeyond the food products, I have also gotten into making my own body washes. East End carries all of the ingredients that I need with multiple options. They have recently redone their store (and are still renovating) and have expanded their meat (they didn't use to carry meat at all) and cheese selections tremendously. The meat is a little pricey, actually the whole store is little pricey, but in my opinion it is well worth it. It's nice knowing that the items are organic and come from sustainable farms. Bonus: they buy as much locally produced items as they can as well. \n\nI really have nothing bad to say about them. The service has always been great and I love the selections and products offered. I can't comment on the cafe as I haven't eaten at it, but I hear the food is great. A combination of East End and the Strip has pretty much replaced Giant Eagle for me.

There are so many options that not only accommodate my annoying food allergy but also support incredible local businesses.\n\nFor my first East End visit, I snagged several items, including incredible locally-made challah bread, three types of flavorful locally-harvested honey, cognac fig cheese, and my favorite amy's pizza in pesto, a flavor that I have never found elsewhere. Thankfully, I was shopping without a basket or cart, or I would have spent well over $100 on my first trip. Instead, I was trying to balance all my great finds in my arms, which limited my purchases.\n\nMy one warning about East End... don't expect Aldi or Trader Joe's prices here. Like Whole Foods, you'll be spending $50 or more on just a bad or two of groceries. Just remember that you're supporting multiple local businesses when shopping here, and you'll leave feeling fulfilled about your money spent!", "type": "review", "business_id": "-iVcmhjfq79QoTWzrb6pKg"}

No matter what kind of health-conscious diet you follow from vegan to paleo - they've got what you need. My favorite items here that you can't really find many other places are raw milk (legal in PA, woo!) and the local meats. The prices on the meat here are higher than most butchers in the area, but on par with the lesser quality meats at Whole Foods - choose your co-op!\n\nI seldom find the produce prices to be ridiculously high. For example, I recently purchased mushrooms at $1.99 per lb. and strawberries for $2.50 per lb., which seem to be two of the more expensive items at any given store. Their sales are worth planning a shopping trip around.\n\nWhen I followed a plant-based diet, the bulk section was my holy grail. For grains, flours, nuts, and seeds, they have a wide variety of unique products. I also love that you can fill a jar and buy it right at the store - most other bulk sections in the 'Burgh don't have this.\n\nAll in all, I like being able to go into a store and not have to sift through the produce to see if it's what I want (organic, local) because it all is! Naturally, they do sell tropical fruits and things that simply do not grow here, but everything is very clearly labeled in its origin and growing method.\n\nThe employees are always friendly and helpful as well. The only terrible thing about this place is the fact that there is almost NEVER parking - I've parked in the lot maybe  ten times out of the ~40 or so times that I've shopped here. I don't mind the walk down, but with heavy bags in my hand, the walk up the street can be tough!", "type": "review", "business_id": "-iVcmhjfq79QoTWzrb6pKg"}

Family-owned.  Off the main roads.  Charming interior.  Unique staff.  WONDERFUL FOOD.  (We called this our \"less-expensive Casbah\" when we left).\n\nLike everywhere we end up going, we go because a Yelp review we have read, that inspired us to give it a try.  We new it was BYOB, but we weren't in the mood for drinking, so we walked on over.  It was our own fault that we got there, at 5:00pm, on the dot - and they were not quite ready to be opened, as they were finishing setting up the tables.  My boyfriend and I took a quick walk around Ellsworth.  It's a family-owned business where they turned their front garage into the most charming, artsy-like, romantic restaurant.  We'll cut them some slack!\n\nWhen we got back, they were ready for us; and we chose to snag a table outside (they thought we were nuts).  However, in one of the reviews, we read that they had no A/C, which was a big selling point for us (I absolutely loathe going into a freezing cold, A/C'd out restaurant, and being forced to bring a hoodie with me, when it's 90+ outside.  And we do kind of like hot, humid, and muggy); but, I guess they have upgraded because the A/C was BLASTING on the inside of the restaurant.\n\nWe started off with the Gazpacho.  This was a perfect summer starter because it was cool, extremely flavorful, and a natural air conditioner to the body.  It had lumps of shrimp and crab meat at the bottom, which made us feel like we were eating somewhere on Duval St. in Key West.  I normally don't like cilantro, but the cilantro was so subtle and completely rounded out the flavor.  When our waitress brought out the freshly baked loaf of corn bread, we sopped up the rest of it.  It is true, the wait staff genuinely appreciates your compliments and feels honored every time you say you enjoyed something.\n\nI ordered the Wild Mushroom Ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the Lamb Burger.  When our dishes came out, they were the most beautiful dishes I had ever seen - full of color, wonderful portion sizing, and aromas just attacking the olfactory with sensational goodness.  My Ravs were topped with this grape tomato paquillo sauce, which tasted like it had hints of red pepper also.  It was FANTASTIC.  Plus, there were whole mushrooms, okra, carrots, and cauliflower on top of the dish as well.  I don't know what kind of separate seasonings were on the veggies, but they were to-die-for also.  I can't exactly remember how many Ravs were in my bowl, but every time I thought I was finished, there was another ravioli to be found, and then another.  For the price - I think there were a total of 10 fully-stuffed, hand-made mushroom ravs.  Incredible.\n\nMy boyfriend's Lamb Burger came with a cranberry and raisin jam (but \"jam\" seems to clich\u00e9 of a word for this topping), and a salad that had slices of apples in it.  Now I'm usually not one to eat sweeter tasting foods; however, the complementing of sweet and savory in this dish blew my mind.  I'm also not a big fruit eater (unless it's blended in a smoothie), but I totally got past all that because the flavors and the textures all are playing nicely with one another.\n\nWe opted out of dessert because we were so stuffed.  But our bill for an appetizer and two filling, insanely delicious entrees came to $40.  DING DING DING DING DING!  WE HAVE FOUND A WINNER!  \n\nAfter dinner the owner came over to our table and we were introduced.  What a wonderful, sweet, and genuine older guy.  We will definitely be back before the menu changes again; and next time, we're going for entrees and dessert!! \n\nOne last thing - it is a Cash Only restaurant, but they do have an ATM on-site.", "type": "review", "business_id": "l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg"}

Who knew the little hole in the wall near my old hair salon had such good food?! My friends and I had known long about it, but last night we were in need of a BYOB ($5 corkage) and found much more than that. \n\nWe started with two appetizers. (A very good tip from a fellow yelper!) One friend is majorly allergic to gluten and our fabulous waiter MORE than accommodated her questions and requests with patience. We all shared some kind of rice stuffed pepper that was moist and exploding with flavor, I forget the name...but definitely a must-have. We also were excited to try the pan-sauteed (not fried) calamari. I'm not a huge fried calamari fan, but this was swimming in olive oil and fresh herbs...it was a lovely delight away from a typically americanized version. \n\nWe also ordered the tomato bisque and the soup of the day. These were insane! The best soups I've ever had out. The soup of the day was a roasted creamy mushroom soup and I almost licked my bowl clean. The flavors were outstanding and we all couldn't decide which soup was better. Make sure to definitely soak everything up with their delicious table bread that seemed to have just come out of the oven every time they replenished our basket! \n\nSomething worth passing is yes, the salads...they're just okay. But my friends raved about their pork and I will not forget the visual of my friend picking up the bone to lick it clean while our waiter just laughed at us! :) \n\nBest part of the story? Well, the food takes a lonnggg time to come out, (warning, but probably because it is so fresh!) after finishing our bottle, our neighboring diners also took advantage of the BYOB but seemed to have left half of theirs when they were done! So after a silly little dare, we became the table of three that snuck 3 large pours of wine and placed it back on their table! Hey! Who was going to drink it anyways?! The little portuguese owner came over and was sincerely shocked at how the wine bottle was empty...she asked, \"Did you three drink this?\" We giggled and my friend's boyfriend said, \"YES.\" She smiled, and let us have our moment. \n\nWe left a big tip.

Because it was our first time, we wanted to do a little bit of this and that.  2 appetizers, Becky s salad and the special of the eve:  smoked salmon on crostini with creme fresh, a clam dish, forgot name, with the best tomatoe-white wine, I could have drunk from the bowl, broth; Becky s salad (the lemon dressing was out of this world delicious--again, could have drunk it, good).  I m usually not fan of walnut in my salad, but the crumbled goat cheese made me forget about my dislike of it, that I ate it happily.  Good pairing.  The special of the night, we opted for sharing the lamb shank with reduced red wine sauce and simple veggies.  Small veggie selection by american standards--half russet potato, slither of zucchini, and a stem of green onion, but the star afterall was the lamb, and it was meduim perfect, just as I ordered!  \n\"Would you care for some dessert?\", Ramon, our waiter (he was fabulous!) asked.  And so round 3 begins.  Coffee, a chocolate mousse with whip cream, beauty and...  their version of creme brulee.  I thought it had a hint of peanut butter, but not sure.  Regardless it was  so, so divine.\nThis place was busy but we did not feel rushed, unlike most places.  The service was great, the atmoshphere quaint; it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe-- alot of repeat clientele, from what I gathered.  We shall return.\nFinally, on an end note. Cafe Zinho is BYOB, so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino.  And they only take cash or personal check, but they do have an ATM.", "type": "review", "business_id": "l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg"}

We brought a few bottles of wine which we paired up with various apps and the dinner. Corkage was an extremely nominal fee which left room in the wallet for more delectable food. The service was smooth and very friendly. The atmosphere was inviting with a small European-style cafe restaurant vibe. Food was fresh and tasty according to all of my friends and was simply amazing from my perspective.  The sardines app and the Portuguese Mariscada seafood stew which I had/shared were cooked perfectly and flavorful. Chef/Owner Toni Pais's back story and his culinary skills are inspirational. He came out to eat afterwards and was very humble when he was given a round of applause. This is truly an underground spot worth finding when in the Burgh, a city that's now a hotbed for excellent food, and Cafe Zinho is one of the reasons why!", "type": "review", "business_id": "l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg"}

Caf\u00e9 Zinho is EVERYTHING.\nThe proprietor of Zinho is one of the nicest gents in the business as far as I'm concerned.  I know this because I had occasion to collaborate with him on a few events 10 years ago.  So while I may be a bit biased, 10 years in between interactions sort of negates that in my opinion.  My point is, if you're one of those people that enjoys patronizing establishments run by nice people, Zinho fits the bill.  \n\nWe arrived last night for my birthday dinner at 7:30 and I immediately fell in love with the place. Nestled along the \"homey\" part of Ellsworth Avenue, Zinho exudes a relaxed luxury that might cater to customers of all types.  Our server Ramon was wonderful, and made thoughtful recommendations for each course.  I selected a roasted beet and goat cheese salad as a starter and crab cakes for my entr\u00e9e.  Neither disappointed. The salad was a tower of carefully combined goodness and the crab cakes were stuffed, not with filler, but succulent crab.  While I'd get the crab cakes again, next time I'm in for the lamb, since one bite of Jonathan D's dish had me hooked so hard I practically baaa'ed (poor lamb).  At $180 for four people it isn't the cheapest option in the 'Burgh, but by no means is it the most expensive. AND, it's BYOB so bring a bottle and enjoy the wonderfulness that is Caf\u00e9 Zinho.", "type": "review", "business_id": "l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg"}

We were looking forward to this for our anniversary, and we weren't disappointed!\n\nWe splurged with three starters:  grilled sardines, octopus, and pheasant terrine.  Each was lovelier than the next.  The terrine was particularly delicious, served with some sort of artisanal mustard and pickled onions on the side, and some nicely grilled bread.  The octopus was perfectly cooked, not rubbery at all, but buttery, nicely seasoned and presented.  The sardines were grill-hot with an ever so slightly charred and crispy skin, and the accompanying vegetables were barely warm, which actually made for a nice contrast.\n\nMain courses:  I had the shellfish stew from the menu.  All of the various seafood was perfectly cooked.  The broth could have had a bit more heat for my taste, but still: lovely.  The husband had one of the specials: cassoulet with venison osso buco. Heavenly, especially on a winter evening.  Gorgeous venison shanks and dome nicely roasted vegetables.\n\nAnother splurge: dessert.  We had the chocolate terrine and the key lime creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, both of which were understated and luxurious.  Not fans of big, vulgar desserts, so these were right up our alley--rich, flavorful, just a nice sweet little end to a perfect meal.\n\nService was especially nice and attentive, but never intrusive.  Loved the shabby chic decor and the oddly shaped dining room.  Must be lovely in the summer with doors open in this quiet corner of Shadyside.

There I chatted with the chef as he prepared my app. Explaining as he went on, first slicing fresh chantrel, portobellos, and button mushrooms. Next he saut\u00e9 them in olive oil, added brown sugar, brandy, raisins, and finished it with heavy cream. They were fantastic. There were a variety of specials including wild boar chops, a risotto with prawns, scallops, and black truffles. But I chose the dry aged filet with lump crab in a leek cream. It was the best piece of filet I've ever had. It was easily a pound of beef and a half pound of crab in a light cream sauce with leeks. I could barely touch it after the pasta, salad, bread, and appetizers. I brought my leftovers home and have them another time. Dessert consisted of a nice portion of carrot cake with an apricot cream cheese icing with apricot jam filling. It was a nice take on an old favorite.

Before sitting down make sure you get in the proper state of mind and prepare yourself for a long night of indulgence. This being my first dining experience at Alla Famiglia, I was unaware of the challenge that I had undertaken. We had A Party of Five, empty bellies and an optimistic mentality; we couldn't resist the tempting appetizers recited to us and ended up ordering the mega meatball, calamari and shrimp, and sausage over polenta. All were amazing. The meatball was the highlight: twelve ounces of perfectly cooked beef, filled with mozzarella and covered in sauce and provolone (kisses fingers). Big plus for including the tentacles in the calamari. I've noticed these legs less and less while dining out, when did they lose suction as a staple of a calamari appetizer? Also adorning our table were a few clothing options in which to dress the bread, all of them enjoyable on their own or as an ensemble.\n\nOne would think after such a hearty opener all that remained was the main course. How wrong of an assumption that turned out to be. Before we could even think about crushing our dinners, we had to face two formidable courses of salad and pasta. As mentioned by other reviewers, the salad is great. Nice dressing, nice fillers, nice roughage. The pasta that's included with the entree was a fusilli bucati in a vodka sauce served family style. Unable to pass up the promise of a great carbonara with guanciale and fresh egg, we had two pasta opponents to tackle. Both were cooked so perfectly al dente I would have put them on my NHL all-star ballot as a write-in if voting hadn't already closed.\n\nAt this point in the meal, I had completely forgotten that I still hadn't even seen my main course. And I was fine with that. As a table we compiled quite the culinary collection: bistecca fiorentina, veal milanese, veal marsala, mussels in a diavola sauce and the sea bass special for the evening. You know when a meal is so utterly divine that you just stop talking to everyone around you and have a one on one pow wow with the gastro-gods? Yeah, that's what happened. I will say at one point during the meal, my brother had to get up and take a walk around the restaurant for fear he would wake up two days later in the ICU if he didn't fight off the impending food coma that threatened his existence. Instead of napkins they should have given us a white towel and a trainer to throw it on the table for us because we were doing our best impression of Apollo Creed...and our food was Ivan Drago.\n\nOur waiter, who we thought was our friend, then had the nerve to ask if we wanted dessert, some balls on that guy. Of course we wanted dessert. We decided on the tiramisu which I hope had a clean bill of health because it blew our minds. It was so good that I was upset with myself. I did exactly what I hate seeing someone do on any and every food network show. I took a bite, put down my fork, closed my eyes and just said, \"wow!\" I just hope it was as good for the tiramisu.\n\nOther housekeeping items: you can bring your own wine for which they charge a corking fee. All the water is bottled, but I didn't see it on the bill so I figure it's included. The chef/owner is extremely friendly and accessible, as he is cooking basically right next to your table. Parking at the meters next to the building is free after 6pm, despite what it says on the signs; our waiter informed us they have an unspoken agreement with the parking authority.\n\nHeavy on the belly, heavy on the wallet, heavy in our hearts!", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

Tiramisu was delectable...light, balanced and very flavorful.\n\nHaven't really added much to the raves from previous patrons...just had to chime in our hearty AMEN of agreement. Love everything about this place. Thank you Jonathan...and all of your staff for an awesome dining experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

To start they set the table with \"Holy Oil,\" which is banana pepper olive oil for dipping Italian bread in, a seasoned cecci bean and cheese gustoso and a goat cheese and olive spread. I wish they sold that banana pepper olive oil because I wanted to have it every day of my life! \n\nWe ordered the famous Meatball appetizer. This meatball is for serious! It's massive and stuffed with mozzarella cheese. Yep, I'm for realz. It was just oozing Italian sexiness, in a ball. As soon as I tasted the red sauce, it tasted like my Grandma's, which sparked fond memories and made me want to actually live in this place. \n\nWe also ordered the Trifolata, which is assorted mushrooms and currants in marsala cream. It was also incredible. The bad/good of it was that it wasn't really needed because they give you so much food, but it was delicious, so whatever!\n\nFor the Third course they serve you your choice of pasta either with their famous home made vodka sauce or fettucini. But here's the thing, the fettucini is made in front of you... in a cheese wheel. Yep, I'm for realz again! I know I'm crazy for not ordering it, but I really love me some vodka sauce and was incredibly happy with this amazing homemade sauce. My hubby got the fetticini and loved it. See, we're all happy here!\n\nFourth course is a salad with red vinagariette, roasted red peppers, candied walnuts, golden raisens and gargonzola cheese. It wasn't memorable amongst all the bangin' dishes but not too shabby at all.\n\nFor the Fifth course (and when I finally tapped out) I ordered the Cioppino with shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops and fish in a saffron and tomato broth with sambuca. It matched all the other dishes. Just incredible. Loved the broth, loved the succulent scallop (just one, but I can't complain, I was stuffed by that point!), the shrimp was jumbo and the fish was perfectly cooked. And the garlic bread was excellent.\n\nWhenever anyone says things are expensive, I usually think they're talking $30 a plate. But, this place is legit expensive. Think $50 (ish) a plate. But what I can tell you is it was 100% worth it! We had leftovers for two days! Talk about an Italian hospitality. Which, by the way, the service was exceptional, but I would have expected that here. \n\nA perfect special night out, if you don't mind unbuckling a couple notches in front of your dining companion, of course!", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

I love it substantially more than any Italian restaurant I have frequented in Italy. If there's a special occasion to celebrate, it's done here, no questions asked. Everything on the menu is phenomenal, and the service is phenomenal as well. The restaurant itself is very intimate and cozy and there is valet available, so the fact that it's in a sketchy neighborhood matters not. The bar upstairs is nice, but dining downstairs is something else, as you can watch your food being prepared. Make sure you visit on an empty stomach, as you will be served multiple courses! The vodka pasta you are given is AMAZING. You also get salad and bread with two dips/oil. Entrees are well-sized and you'll probably have the leftovers ever after gorging on all of the mini meals that come before the entree. I do not eat beef... until i go to alla famiglia and order the meatball appetizer. That's saying something, so don't forget to order it. My mum gets some hunk of beef (sorry, I don't even really look at beef/pork options) every time we go and I can hear her making moaning noises as she chews, and then she talks about how to die for it was afterward. I usually get a seafood dish, whatever it may be at the time, and it is always one of the greatest things I have and will ever eat. I want my final meal to be from Alla Famiglia. Please.

I knew I kept him around for some reason!\n\nSo on a cold, snowy Saturday night, we trudged up the mountain. And it was glorious.\n\nFirst off, it IS in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood. But no worries - they have valet, so you don't have to deal with trying to find somewhere to park and walking around.\n\nThe Holy Oil is the best thing I've ever dipped bread into - and I'm a dipper. I come from an Italian family - we dip everything into everything - bread into sauce, cookies into coffee, bread into coffee, etc. This is by far the best dipping experience I've ever had.\n\nOnto the MEATBALL. We got the mozzarella-stuffed meatball for our appetizer. The meatball was good. The sauce was great. There isn't much more I can say about it, to be honest. It was just so, so yummy.\n\nSalad course: Great salad!\n\nPasta course: So, I was slightly disappointed that they did not give us a choice. I was really looking forward to the fettuccine in the cheese wheel that I had read about here! Alas, only vodka sauce. Great vodka sauce, though. I should've asked about that damn cheese wheel...\n\nFor the main course, I got the veal chop milanese and it was perfect. My friend got the cioppino and he enjoyed that very much.\n\nI could not even think about eating dessert. We had so much food. I took 1/2 of my pasta course and 3/4 of my main course home.

The veal chop is almost as large as my arm (not joking) and was delicious, prepared either of their two signature ways. For the filet, I do not like gorgonzola so I asked them to prepare it a different way (which they are very willing to do and usually announce to the table at the beginning of the meal). It was done is a mushroom sauce that was a perfect compliment to the perfectly cooked filet.\n\nFinally, do not forget to save room for dessert (which will be fairly difficult considering the sheer volume of food that they give you).

This is the framed \"art\" inside the women's restroom located on the 2nd floor. Odd. I nearly poked my eyes out with my mascara brush from staring. It's hypnotizing.\n\nNow that we got that out of the way, let's talk about  the restaurant!\n\nAfter months of whining, a group of 8 of us finally decided to nut up or shut up and finally made plans. (Thank you, Samantha B. for organizing!)\n\nGetting a reservation for 8 is not an easy task. The building is a three-story, traditional townhouse  that is very narrow leaving only so much space inside for the dining area, bar, and the kitchen. And, it is located in the middle of Allentown. Yes, Allentown. This fact could qualify as the baby elephant in the room but it seems to be the trend to operate fantastic restaurants in areas that would make your average xenophobe from suburbia go bat shit cray cray.  And, for the record, I'm not drinking Hatorade. I was equally \"scurred\"  during the drive up E. Warrington Avenue...and I live in the East End where hipsters and old school hippies are known to reside and give peace a chance. \n\nThe reality is what it is. It's a scary part of town but it did not matter a damn when we got out of the car. It was a Saturday night and we were greeted by an average Joe  valet who sincerely welcomed us to the restaurant  and told us to enjoy our dinner. The locals who walked by smiled and nodded as if they were giving us their approval. It's as if the restaurant was under a dome, protected by a force field that doesn't allow the stereotypical nonsense most would fear when entering Allentown at night. \n\nWe were greeted by our server who immediately took our drink orders. I didn't see a bar on the first floor so I almost hesitated to order my usual dirty martini and my sweetheart's Manhattan, thinking they were limited in their mixology. Orders were taken without pause and both drinks were most impressive. Our friends enjoyed vino rossos and biancos from their diverse wine list that is 100% Italia! \n\nTables are set with \"Holy Oil\" for dipping artisanal Italian breads, a seasoned cheese and cecci bean gustoso, and, my favorite, a fresh goat cheese olive spread.\n\nWe started with the artichoke appetizer special and shared the meatball appetizer with the rest of the table. Yes, shared. The meatball is bigger than Barry Bonds and Kanye West's egos combined. And, it was friggin' fantastic. The flavors, the marinara sauce, the mozzarella stuffed inside...If I could marry a meatball, this would be matrimonial bliss.\n\nMy sweetheart chose the highly recommended veal chop Milanese. This is yet another piece of meat listed on the menu not small in size. Because I am always the a-hole of the group, I asked if I could have Linguine and Clam sauce instead of the pasta prep on the menu. Again, no hesitation. Wow. But the groans from my our table makes me still an a-hole. I DON'T CARE! IT WAS MY CARB DAY DAMNIT! :-)\n\nOur entrees did not disappoint. TASTY!!!! The entrees minus the pasta came with salad and pasta side served family style. Lots of food to be shared.\n\nWe finished with the hand-spun espresso gelato. Others at the table went for other gelato flavors and the Tiramisu. We all had spoons to share. All were \"delish\".\n\nI was tempted to order the other highly recommended entree, the Cowboy Steak Diane. My friend Beth had the pleasure. The wild mushrooms on her dish looked just as big as the meatballs and she raved about the Worcestershire butter. She offered me a sample but I was too full and ready to birth my food baby.\n\nOh yeah. How could I forget! Franco Harris walked in. SHUT UP!!! Not entirely surprising after viewing the wall on the second floor covered with photos of VIPs posing with the chef/owner. \n\nIt's great to see a gem in Allentown that can shine a light on the other diamonds in the ruff in that area. But don't let  the neighborhood fool you. This restaurant is VERY high end in service, cuisine, price, and atmosphere.\n\nI really enjoyed my experience at Alla Familigia so maybe it wasn't such a coincidence they placed The Terminator's Mr. Universe pic in the restroom...because...

Just delicious, must have.\nWhen you order an entree you also get their house salad served in a homemade Italian vinaigrette (light and complimenting to the diverse salad topped with great peppers!) and their Penne Alla Vodka. This pasta dish alone is enough to warrant a visit . I am a alla vodka lover and this is the best I've ever had. It's hard to describe but its not to rich or creamy it's absolutely just right. The pasta itself was so smooth and melted in your mouth with their sauce.\n\nFor entree my girlfriend had their Ahi Tuna Steak (special). Prepared perfectly and with a great lemon butter sauce. I had their speciality, their double cut Veal Chop. This is something straight out of The Flintstones in its portion but let me tell you it's with every penny. I had the Veal Chop Pizzoaloa style wivh was with hot & sweet peppers, a great tomato sauce covered in provolone cheese. This was such a moist Veal Chop that literally fell off the bone and with the marbling it just melted in your mouth. \nEverything was spectacular , it's a restaurant you have to visit if your in the area at least once given you are willing to spend for your meal. $$$$ but you absolutely get what you pay for.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

This was by far the best veal dish I have ever had and at $65 I would almost call this a steal. The vodka sauce pasta starter that comes with it is wonderful in and of itself, and the salad, the salad is spectacular! That's the thing about this place, not a single aspect of the meal disappoints or falls short of amazing. I did not order an appetizer as I had to send some of the pasta back as well as some of the veal because I just couldn't eat it all - this will feel like a sin, but what can you do. I am sure the appetizers are amazing as well. Lets not forget the martini that I would say is about the best you're going to find in \"the Burgh\"! Not to mention it's BYOB, I brought my favorite bottle of California red wine to take the guess work out of the wine selection and guarantee an amazing amazing meal.

We had reservations for 7:30 on a Tuesday, so we obviously figured we would be seated immediately.  The brother and his girlfriend arrived a couple minutes before the reservation and were told to go up to the bar while they set the table and wait for the rest of the party.  I arrived about a minute after and my husband a few minutes behind me as he needed to park due to the lack of valet during the week.  There was no one at the host stand when either of us came in.  So we went up to the bar, declined a drink... and waited, and waited.  The bartender soon became deeply involved in picking a wine for a couple at the bar, not his fault.  The brother eventually was able to flag down a waitress to ask if she could check on our table.  She looked very annoyed.  She eventually went over to the phone at the bar, called down, hung up the phone and said, dead pan, \"no, it's not ready yet.\"  Not a smile, not a sorry, not a \"can we get you a drink on the house?\" Meanwhile, there was an open table for 4 on that floor.  The bartender eventually told us \"that's for a reservation.\" \"Yes, we have a reservation... for 25 minutes ago.\"  \"They must have specifically requested that table.\"  They did, however, offer us the table right next to the door on the first floor though - the one with the 10 degree breeze coming in that night.  No thank you.  We were very insulted by the lack of table for our reservation, but more so by the lack of acceptable service.  We decided to leave and spend $20 on pizza instead of $100+ per person and enjoyed much better service.. which is never the way it should be.  Hopefully they solve this problem soon.  We'll give it one more go when the insult has worn off.\n\nMy husband won't hesitate to tell you what his favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh is: Alla Famiglia.  And to be honest, these days I agree with him!  \n\nWhile my husband enjoys many of the more \"up and coming\" restaurants with smaller portions and interesting flavor combinations, he often finds himself longing for the same quality food with better cuts of meat and bigger portions.  This is where we satisfy both of our appetites for big flavor and, well, big portions.  But to reduce Alla Famiglia to those two things alone would not do it justice.\n\nLet's start out instead with addressing the two biggest critiques of this place: its location and the price.  Yes, it is in Allentown, but they also have plenty of parking and valet if you prefer.  Honestly, we drive almost everywhere to get dinner, so this is not an issue for us.  The other thing I always hear about is how expensive it is.  Some of those complaints come from people who I know have no problem giving their money to the big steakhouse chains, while getting a lot less value.  No, it is not cheap.  You will likely pay upwards of $50 for your entry.  The veal chops are close to $70.  But, that's not all you get.  You get delicious, fresh baked bread, a spread, dipping oil and gustoso for same, a delicious salad, and homemade pasta served family style.  If you wanted to be especially frugal, you could approach this place like an Olive Garden senior special: feast on the freebies and take your entree to go.  But, even if you're full, it may be too difficult not to savor the meal as it comes out...\n\nI've been here twice and my husband has been here three times (lucky - he got to go for work and he said they ordered almost every appetizer, all of which were apparently delicious).  The first time I ordered the filet with gorgonzola.  It was one of the most delicious and largest filets I've ever had.  My husband ordered a veal chop with prosciutto which I don't think I recognized on the current menu, but he absolutely loved it.  The veal chop is one of the largest bone-in cuts of meat I've seen and the sear on it was absolutely perfect.  We also ordered the mussels, which were spicy and delicious, and the meatball appetizer, which I remember being tasty, but nothing too out of the ordinary.  I think there are other things on the menu to try first. \n\nThe second time we came I ordered the Milanese veal chop, breaded, slightly citrusy, and absolutely heavenly.    He had the cowboy ribeye which was also large and an absolutely beautiful cut of meat.  The husband has a thing about fatty cuts and avoiding anything that is the least bit chewy, and he barely had to leave a piece on his plate.  We also got the calamari appetizer, which was perfectly, lightly fried with a savory, garlic sauce that sets it apart from the sweet sauces often served with calamari.\n\nFinally, I should note that the service we have received here has always been exceptional.  Everyone is always professional and courteous.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

We were treated extremely well from the second we walked in the door.  They even had a menu printed with a \"Happy birthday Jennifer\" message on the top!  What a nice touch.\n\nWe were seated in the area near the door with a view of the kitchen.  There is also a small room (three tables) on the same floor.  The upper floor has a dining area and bar, but they are often booked for private events.\n\nWhen you arrive, there are three accompaniments for your fresh baked bread.  The \"holy oil\" that is an olive oil and banana pepper mix.  It lives up to its name because it was divine.  There was also a goat cheese spread that had red peppers and olives.  I'm a huge goat cheese fan, so I could have eaten this by the spoonful.  There was also a bean and cheese mixture with three types of cheese chopped up.  It was incredible as well.  You may be tempted to fill up on these delictible delights, but don't, becase as good as these items are, it only gets better from there.\n\nWe were having a hard time deciding whether to get the meatball appetizer or the hand pulled mozzarella.  The waitress steered us towards their meatball since it is one of their signature items.  It was a wise decision.  The meatball is the size of a fist and it was perfect.  I don't usually like meatballs or red sauce and I found myself devouring every last bit of both on this plate.  The meatball is stuffed and topped with an excellent mozzarella and then drenched with an amazing red sauce with bits of garlic.  If you order this, make sure you are sharing because it is huge. \n\nThe salad course was very tasty.  It as a mix of field greens, an olive oil dressing, gorgonzola and other incredibly tasty things.  I could have eaten the entire plate of it myself but wanted to save room for the pasta and my entree.\n\nThe pasta course is a house made spiral pasta in a vodka sauce.  It was extremely tasty.  So much so that my husband said he would have been happy if that alone had been his main course.  It had such incredible fresh taste.  \n\nFor our main courses, I got the veal chop prepared in the milanese style.  It was HUGE, pretty much the size of the plate.  A nice surprise considering how small portions tend to be at other fancy restaurants in the area.  It was served with a lemon butter sauce and had large chunks of crab on top.  It was tender and you could cut it with a fork.  I savored every bite (and have leftovers to enjoy at home).  My husband had the filet and loved his choice as well.  A lot of flavors and extremely tender.  It was served with a leek cream and I would love to know how they make it because I have leeks at home that I need to use for something.\n\nI swore I didn't have room left for even a single bite more, but when I learned that pumpkin gelato was the dessert, I had to try it.  It was so smooth, sweet and reminded me of the amazing gelato I had when I was in Italy.  A house made limoncello completed my incredibly amazing meal.\n\nYes, it is expensive, but it is worth it!  I don't know when we'll be back simply because of how expensive it is, but I do know we'll be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

I am becoming a Yinzer...\n\nThe bread and holy oil, chickpea dish, and goat cheese spread that they set the table with was amazingly good, and it only gets better.  All their meals come with a salad and a pasta dish with vodka sauce.  (I didn't see anything about fettucine in a cheese wheel, so maybe they don't do that anymore--not sure.)\n\nI ordered seafood diavolo but could only finish about 1/3 of it, and my husband ordered a steak dish that he (amazingly) polished off.  He said it was the best steak he's had since we left Nebraska, so that's a pretty high compliment.\n\nYes, this place is expensive ($50-ish/entree), but you can DEFINITELY get at least two meals from one, and there is an option to share a dinner with a $15 charge for the extra pasta and salad dish, which may be the route I would take in the future since I'm a snacker and would rather have an appetizer as dinner anyway.\n\nI think everyone in the 'burgh should try this place at least once, for a special occasion dinner because it's awesome!", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

I finally ate here this past Saturday and it was awesome.  Now I can't wait to come back!\n\nFirst, I urge you to make a reservation because every single table was filled while we were there, and for good reason--the food is AWESOME.  The food is so good you aren't even going to feel guilty about the calories you have consumed--because you will eat A LOT OF THEM.\n\nThe second thing you need to know is to show up HUNGRY.  Don't eat all day.  If possible, do what I did and work out earlier in the day, because you will leave this restaurant WELL FED.  To quote one of the great artists of our time, Ice Cube, \"Life ain't a track meet, its a marathon!\"\n\nIt is a marathon.  They're going to bring you out delicious warm bread as soon as you sit down, and supply you with heavenly toppings for it, including the famous Holy Oil that is truly divine.  Temperance is a virtue.  Don't be like me and commit a sin against your entree by eating it when you are STUFFED, and can't fully enjoy it. because like a fool you couldn't restrain yourself with the bread bc carbs turn you into AN ANIMAL and you didn't pace yourself.\n\nYou'll get all the bread you can handle.  Our waiter John, who was super nice and attentive, suggested we order the meatball appetizer and he was right.  Its huge, its literally the size of a softball and comes out wrapped in cheese, in a heavenly marinara sauce, served with love.  It was extremely good.  \n\nThen you get the salad course, which comes in a home made vinagrette which is also delicious.  \n\nThen comes the pasta course,  We had fusilli pasta in vodka sauce which was very good but at this point I was basically full and tapping out.  I ended up eating not even 1/4 of my pasta, but then the waiter offered to bag it up for me, so I had lunch for the next day.\n\nYour entree comes out after the pasta course, and you're going to be already stuffed at this point.\n\n Now, I took my friend here for his birthday.  I think they key is to come here when you are not paying, bc my bank account was crying when I saw the entrees start at $40.  More on that in a moment.\n\nI ordered the filet and it was SPECTACULAR.  I mean, amazing.  So good I did not share, and after I ate it, I fondly reflected on the time my filet and I spent together.  Temporarily in my mouth, forever in my heart.  Or on my hips.  It was not diet food, it was covered in some sort of heavenly cream cheese sauce that is the stuff dreams are made of.  It was a $60 dinner and it tasted like one too.  \n\nMy friend ordered the blackened sea bass and it came out looking like a work of art.  Both our dishes were basically food porn.  He loved his dinner too and said that his fish came out topped with large chunks of crab and he loved it.\n\nWe were waayyy too full to even think about dessert.  I'm sure the desserts would have been divine but we just could not do it.  In fact I ended up taking half my filet home with me.\n\nThis place is technically expensive, but if you think about it, it's really not that bad.  Our bill came to $200 for the two of us, but for what you get, it's really a pretty damn good deal.  You get top notch service, the restaurant itself is beautiful, and the food is absolutely incredible.  This was probably the best meal I have had in Pittsburgh.  Oh--and you get enough food that you get a full meal the next day.\n\n I cannot believe that I had not been here before, and I will absolutely be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

We have found that to find quality Italian worthy of spending $$ outside of our own home has been difficult to find in the Burg. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of Italian restaurants out there, but none we would seek out for a special occasion, so to speak. We have always found the New York/New Jersey establishments more to our liking....until now.\n\nAlla Famiglia is nestled in a not so nice of a neighborhood in the Burg called Allentown. Although we were never worried, but I could see how some may feel it is out of place in it's location. There is valet parking, so need to worry about your car while dining. Now once you are inside, you will soon forget where you are.\n\nThe inside is very small and there are 3 floors where you may be seated for your meal. On this occassion, we were seated on the third floor. Way up, climbing 3 flights of stairs can work up an appetite. Once on the 3rd level however, you can enjoy some of the religious artwork and beautiful stainglass featured throughout the dining area. There were 5 tables of various sizes and the bonus was the private restroom located nearby, so you did not have to manage the steps again until you were finished with your meal. \n\nI would also like to mention that we were dining early and although the room was rather private at first, it became QUITE loud as the evening went on and other patrons were being seated. I also think the free flowing wine helped the noise levels as the night progressed. Needless to say, we had difficulty hearing one another towards the end of the meal.\n\nThere were 5 in our party and our server was very attentive throughout the night to make sure any requests or special customizations were welcomed and met. We started our meal with the complimentary bread, dipping oils, goat cheese spread and cheese medley brought to the table. We all agreed to share the famous 12 oz stuffed meatball which was enjoyed by everyone at the table. In fact, everyone was asking for more of the wonderful sauce to accompany thier bread.\n\nSeveral items are served family style and come with any of the entrees that are ordered. We were then delivered and very tasty salad tossed with a light vinegarette which included olives, nuts and cranberries. Gorgonzola was brought on the side if desired. Then the pasta with vodka sauce made it's arrival. Several mentioned that they would have just ordered this if they knew how delicious it was. And this was just the beginning....\n\nOn came the entrees, several veal dishes were ordered, as it is their signature item on the menu. Although there were also many specials offered that night, everyone seemed to gear towards the classics. I ordered the veal marsala, which was delish! It was certainly one of the best I have had. One member of our dining party ordered the special pork chop offered that was huge! Another entree ordered was the filet mignon topped with lump crab meat and gorgonzola cream sauce. It literally melted in your mouth! I decided this would definitely be ordered on my next visit. All the food was cooked perfectly to order and scrumptious!\n\nWe were all pretty full but decided to share the Burnt almond tiramisu stuffed with raspberry for dessert. It was divine! I swear I heard the angels in the nearby painting sing as we devoured it!\n\nAs others had mentioned, it is a bit pricey, but for special occassions it is a must do. I felt it was quite worth every penny of our bill which was $306 for the party of 5. (We did BYOB) We have dined at much more expensive establishments and left unimpressed, which was not the case at all here.\n\nThe only negative was the long walk down the steps through the many other diners after too much wine. It can be challenging! So, watch your step! But do make a visit, you won't be disappointed!", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

They bring out a pasta with vodka sauce about 5 minutes before the entrees, sort of like a side to the meal. My boyfriend got the Veal Chop Milanese which was excellent, soft with a crispy crust. I got the Seafood Diavolo, it was pure seafood heaven for me. It had a nice spicy kick to it, without being overbearing. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly. I will say that it is not a cheap restaurant (entrees started at $50), so definitely a special occasion place, but totally worth it!", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

The service was very good, and all the staff were working very hard and quick, but were available to answer questions and assist us when needed.  I would recommend making reservations well in advance and trying to get one of the tables upstairs - a more quiet and intimate setting, also slightly more comfortable temperature wise for me.

The first slice of the day with completely cold, unmelted cheese was always just as good as the last one which would have melted the cheese slightly and gotten the tiniest bit less crunchy. It doesn't matter because the ingredients themselves are just tasty. But tragedy struck and Cranberry failed hard again at supporting good pizza and the store closed. I did some research online and discovered that, yes, DiCarlo's did still exist, but only in faraway lands that I would likely never travel to for pizza or any other reason.\n\nBut one day, I noticed something exhilarating. Is that a DiCarlo's location IN PITTSBURGH?! HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN HERE? I felt confused, excited, bashful, sleepy, doc, but most of all relieved. That is until I decided I would need to confirm their existence with a quick phone call. See above.\n\nThat very night, I traveled to the south hills (a rare treat...) to rekindle my love affair. I gotta say, friends, this was one of the best first bites I have ever had. Exactly as I remember it. Four slices of pepperoni pizza and an Orange Crush. This is living.

(Both the families liked the food very much.)  Max's is the best German food in Pittsburgh -- actually, it's the best German food I've had outside of Germany, and I've definitely had worse meals in Germany as well.\n\nMax's is in a restored hotel, and the decor is very much in the Victorian style of the original hotel building.  The exception is the bar area that's good for happy hour or watching a game, or just having a beer -- that has a lot of neon and a jukebox.  But the bar area is also tasteful and pleasant to be in.  Max's has a full bar, but their real specialty is their excellent selection of German beers, both in bottles and on tap.\n\nI haven't met a wurst I didn't like, and they're pretty much all offered here.  The Braunschweiger sandwich is pretty delicious and unique in my experience, and the schnitzels are very delicious as well.  Another specialty is the kase spatzle (Spatzle noodles with smoked Gouda cheese -- a twist on mac and cheese that ensures that even a picky child will have something to enjoy here), but my two favorite menu picks here are the hassenpfeffer and the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing.  For sides, the red cabbage salad is my favorite, although the sauerkraut is also very good.  I don't care for the German potato salad, however -- I like the kind that has caraway seeds and vinegar, and is served cold, but Max's offers the kind that has an unidentifiable sauce and is served warm.  Some people like that style of potato salad though, and from what I can tell, Max's does a decent rendition of it.\n\nIf you're looking to reserve a room here for a banquet, you have a lot of options.  The basement \"Rathskellar\" is more bar-like in its atmosphere.  It would be a good place for some guys to have a birthday party or something.  For a rehearsal dinner or other formal event, one of the upstairs banquet rooms would be better.  Depending on the size of your group, you can arrange to have a buffet-style dinner, or individuals in the group can order directly off the regular dinner menu.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ"}

I'm sure there's better German food with cuter waitresses somewhere out there that doesn't have the decor aesthetics of your grandma's living room.  But who cares.  This place is just right.\n\nFinal note, I can't speak for the brunch buffet.  I went in there for the buffet once and decided that my money would be better spent on the menu.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ"}

How I have never noticed it when walking by it on East Ohio Street, not 10 minutes from my house, I will never understand.  Maybe because the entrance is set back from the sidewalk a bit, so it looks dark (i.e. possibly closed) when you first walk by.  Or maybe because it's overshadowed by the Isaly's next door.  Please, I beg of you, fellow Yelpers, don't ignore this place any longer!\n\nPlease note, as other reviewers have, that North Shore Deli is cash only.  But believe me, you won't need much.  They do have a website that really just lists the sandwiches they offer and their hours or see my photo of the menu board showing the sandwiches available (all named after local streets).  \n\nIt was difficult to decide on just one sandwich.  But after reading the few reviews here, I decided to go with the hot sausage.  When I first arrived, the meat was still cooking.  I didn't mind, I told the gentleman I would return and took a stroll over to Priory for some sweet treats for later.  When I returned, I was the only patron there but was greeted again and friendly small talk ensued.  I opted for a side of macaroni salad as well.  \n\nWhen I got home and unwrapped my sandwich, I was surprised by the hot sausage that looked like it was exploding at both ends.  And that it was, my friends.  Exploding with flavor, that is.  The ends were crispy and delicious and the sausage was just hot enough that the macaroni salad was the perfect cool salad compliment.

We didn't have a reservation but the server seated us anyways (we had to be done by 7).  It is BYOB but they deal you a $4 corkage fee per person drinking.  The bread sticks were fresh and warm and were the perfect accompaniment to the delicious soup du jour, potato soup.  The side salad that comes with the meal would make the hall of fame for any side salad league.  It came with olives, Gorgonzola, julienned carrots and other veggies.  I had the pork tenderloin with veggies and mashed potatoes.   The tenderloin was perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes were like having two aces in the hole.   It would be tough to find a better waitstaff.   Plates disappeared, water was filled, and I never knew they were there.  If your looking for a place to try before going to the casino or bucco game this is a sure bet, just call ahead for reservations.  They do have outdoor seating but the views wont show up on any postcard.

We walked into the door and there was a woman standing near the door and she shot us a look of surprise (or frustration) and asked if we had a reservation? Well that wasn't the greeting I was expecting and was surprised at this question since the place was empty but within a half hour I totally understood why.\n\nThis small but quaint restaurant filled up very fast.  This establishment is just lovely and was clean and was decorated for the holiday season.  It was cozy.   The menu was small but had something for everyone and the prices weren't too bad but It might be a little pricey if you are on a budget but it's worth it trust me.   \n\nThe service was excellent.. we received beverages and bread within a moments time.  Our bread basket never remained empty either. \nWe ordered the \"beans and greens\" as an appetizer and it was delicious. My Italian Mother makes this dish all the time and it was \"almost\" as good as hers - which is saying a lot.  \n  \nI had penne pasta with sausage, roasted red peppers, olives and artichokes.   It was very tasty but was a bit salty for my taste (think it was the olives) but still delicious.  My friend ordered the Walleye and was very pleased.  The tossed salad that came with my entree was just the right size and everything was fresh.\nFresh greens and was accompanied by carrots, red onions, feta, cherry tomatoes and olives.   By the time we were ready to leave there wasn't an empty table in the place.  \nThe restaurant is located on the corner at a very convenient location in North side with parking available on the street right outside the restaurant. Getting back on 279 was a snitch. \n\nThe restroom doors were so festive and unique that I couldn't resist taking a picture !!   The restrooms were also clean too.\n\nI love restaurants that aren't \"chains\" and have their own flair .. and this establishment has that! \n\nI am very happy we decided to have dinner at Legends of the North Shore and will no doubt be visiting again ... \n\nBravo !", "type": "review", "business_id": "q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ"}

We ordered the pasta special and it was amazing.  It was shrimp and crab ravioli in a white wine sauce, cooked with asparagus, roasted yellow peppers, and mushrooms.  It was probably the best ravioli I ever had.  It was topped with four huge pieces of shrimp cooked to perfection.  Most meals come with either soup or salad, either is guaranteed to be delicious, and some bread served with olive oil for dipping.  Some other things I've had that I really enjoyed were the spaghetti and meatball, the hot anti-pasta, and their fudge.  Everything has a very home cooked feel to it, better than mom used to make.  They also use the freshest of ingredients, the secret to any good Italian meal.  The service here is very good too, and very friendly.

I had made 7 PM reservations for us and we arrived shortly before that to a table that was ready for us.  The inside of the restaurant is actually much tinier than I had expected with as many people crammed in as possible.  It probably was helped that the night we were there, there was a party of 10+ next to us.  They would also order just before us understandably leading to some slower service times for us which I would guess is not the norm.  Other than it being crowded there was not much else in the dining room to look, just some table and chairs as well as some pictures on the walls.\n\nFor dinner my girlfriend and I decided to start of the evening with the polenta to share.  It came out cut into pieces and served with some sweet sausage and a pesto drizzle.  I thought that the sweet sausage was the best part of it with the polenta being ok while my girlfriend really enjoyed the polenta.  For our dinner entrees I ordered the Penne Vodka which came with a tomato basil cream sauce and prosciutto while my girlfriend went with the Penne Parma that had some artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, olives and sweet sausage in a garlic wine sauce.  Both pastas also came with salads before the meal and both my girlfriend and I ordered the house balsamic dressing.  The salads came topped with many different things and I thought that they were pretty good salads for being included in the meal.  The Penne Vodka that I ordered ended up being really good!  It was delivered when still at a fairly hot temperature and I really enjoyed the sauce.  It's only peculiar item was that the prosciutto was almost off to the side and not in the pasta which I found to be odd but I still enjoyed it.  Even though I really enjoyed my pasta, I actually thought that my girlfriends meal tasted better.  The garlic wine sauce on hers was awesome and made each bite of her entr\u00e9e that I had a treat.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again.  I was very happy with all of the food that we had and also loved that the prices were good for the quality of food that they were serving.", "type": "review", "business_id": "q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ"}

He was very patient with us.\n\nAfter tasting the magnificent ribs, we told him that these were the best ribs we'd ever tasted (also over the dratted television noise). The guy was positively beaming and we had a nice conversation with him. He said the recipe has been in the family for 140 years so far. He also said that the style was Louisiana BBQ. I had mild and my brother-in-law had hot. We were both extremely satisfied. There was plenty of meat on the ribs and they were done to perfection. They did not have cole slaw but we did try potato salad--very good too!\n\nThe ambiance is nothing to write home about, but it seemed good enough.

They live within walking distance of my home, so it's no problem getting here and the temptation for sushi is always in the back of my mind! Admittedly, the price of the food here tends to keep my cravings in check for a couple months at a time, but when I do come here, I enjoy every bite. Occasionally I also order take-out since they have very reasonable lunch deals, but really, I prefer to sit and eat at the restaurant itself.\n\nSpeaking of: the place itself is very quiet, which I actually like; I can just sit, talk with a friend or read a book, and then (what a radical concept) enjoy my food in peace. This is a big deal for me because the other places I know of where I can get sushi are loud, busy, and quite frankly, a little limiting options-wise compared to Sushi Three's menu. If I want sushi, I either come here or I get a small pack at Giant Eagle. That's how much I dislike eating in the other sushi places I've visited in Pittsburgh to date (although with more and more places opening this opinion may change soon!). If I'm going to pay as much as I do for my fish, I want to be in a place I can sit and actually enjoy my food.\n\nBy the way, Sushi Three does serve things other than sushi, so people looking for some Japanese food that isn't rice and fish are definitely going to find something. There's some really delicious beef, chicken and pork dishes (one family member of mine absolutely adores their pork katsudon). But of course, a place with the word \"sushi\" in its name is going to specialize in sushi, and there are pages and pages of sushi options available here. The orders come in various styles and sizes as well, so couples can get something to share or just get something smaller for themselves. The combos all come with soup and salad, which are also very yummy. My personal routine order as of today is a large salad and an order of softshell crab rolls. Sure, I'll occasionally snag a bite from someone here with me, but the truth is that Sushi Three makes such enormous orders that I need to be reeeally hungry to eat all of any other order I make. \n\nBut hey, at least you get your money's worth! I say definitely give this place a shot if you're a sushi fan.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QnyzlVMyx0Exri-Lay10cA"}

I love the mesh of old and new.  I love a greasy spoon.  Most of all, I love the fact that I can visit here any time of the day.\n\nI have heard of Tom's for a very long time.  I remember there being a Tom's in the South Side and visiting it many times, but this spot is so different.  There's a different vibe here, more laid back, less bustle.  Walking in here makes you feel as if you are entering a tiny road stop diner, you kind of forget that you are still within the Pittsburgh region, especially if you stop here in the wee hours of the morning.\n\nI grabbed a booth to myself and within a minute the waitress was there to hand me a menu and ask me what I wanted to drink.  Looking over the menu took me some time seeing how this was my first visit here.  I ended up ordering a BLT with a side of loaded fries.  While waiting for my food to arrive I looked around the place and took it all in.  The colors, decor, and furniture definitely give you that diner vibe.  When I think of a diner I think of the shiny chrome, the bright white and red checkered pattern and bar stools at a counter.  All of that is here!\n\nMy food finally arrived and I started to dive into it.  The first thing that popped into my head was, \"why did I order a side of fries?\"  The BLT comes with a decent side portion of fries to begin with, I really didn't need more fries.  The BLT itself was perfect.  The bacon was greasy, yet crisp, the lettuce was refreshing and the tomato was just the right thickness.  Add a little mayo to the toasted bread and we are in business.  It was so good I wish I had just ordered two BLTs.  The loaded fries were pretty good as well.  Topped with cheese sauce and bacon (man, I just couldn't get enough of that bacon).\n\nThe waitress on duty was super polite and very attentive.  Even though it was very early in the morning, she did not miss a beat or sit around.  The only gripe I have about this place is the prices.  Some of them need to be readjusted, but other than that, it's a stellar place to get a meal.\n\n**something to note: they do serve alcohol here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "m61vZsAxmTEq3uiCjFjM8Q"}

The crust, sauce, and cheese illustrate unique qualities of Pittsburgh pizza.  Crust tends to be thin like New York pizza, but chewy rather than crunchy.  Pizzerias often use a blend of provolone and mozzarella or straight provolone, and if it's a pizzeria worth anything, the cheese will snap when melted (think of how stringy the cheese gets on cheap delivery pizza).  Pittsburgh pizza sauce will taste distinctly of red wine and not oregano (thank God).   Beto's parbakes the pizza and then finishes it for a few minutes before topping it with the cold cheese (by the way, they'll melt it if you tell them).   If you like provolone and want perfect Beto's, get six squares to go, and leave them in the box about 10 minutes.   Last time I flew into Pgh, my mom sent me to Beto's before I even got to her house.  They've been open for 61 years without offering delivery service, and only the best pizzerias can make that claim.  It's not for everyone, I suppose.

Let me explain, we didn't want to order generic, neighborhood delivery pizza. Pretty much I'm tired of tasteless, no crust pies that lack nuance. Since lesbian friend of Joe D lives in Dormont, Beto's was a natural. She's never had the beto's experience. So I told her to follow my lead, I ordered two slices, one with black olives, the other was plain, small drink. She ordered two slices , extra cheese and pepperoni. I forgot to tell her, nay, I purposely didn't tell her about the cheese because I knew she'd turn her nose up at it because the idea of cheese not melted on a pizza would surely upset the planets and cause disruption in the space/time continuem. But it backfired on me and the one thing I didn't expect was her to order extra cheese. \n\nWe sat down and I explained to her the total stupidity of ordering a large drink in a place that offers free refills. Order a small, it's way cheaper and this really sounds like a scene that could have played out on an episode of Seinfeld.\n\nPizza time! The look on her face was one of shock, like mine when I realized that America was indeed stupid enough to elect George Bust for a second term. The cheese was piled high, and no visible evidence of anything under this massive mass of diary goodness. Like a trooper she picked up a slice and dived in. She liked it!\n\nAfter we downed our slices I told her how sitting here has brought me back to my high school years.

The secret to their pizza- a combination of regular, melted cheese and then a whole bunch of cold cheese on top. It creates a beautiful harmony of dairy delights. This is deserving of a normal picture.", "type": "review", "business_id": "93UCt9OgWYmypZCpXtUu8g"}

Crust is crispy and the sauce is delicious. \n\nEatability I'd give a 2/10. The whole point of pizza is that you can bend it in half and then stuff it in your face. Here it's more of a fork and knife operation. The cheese falls right off because it's not melted so you end up slurping it up like spaghetti. \n\nI dig it though. Good job beto's.

My wife and I were celebrating our 1 year anniversary and wanted to grab brunch after we had gone for massages in the morning, somewhere laid back that we could also watch the olympics. When I called I didn't see the Yelp page that mentioned no reservations so I asked anyway. I spoke to Joe Demarco(sp?) who was AWESOME! When I told Joey that we wouldn't be able to make it there until 12:30 (they stop serving breakfast at noon) he told me not to worry and that they'd make an exception for us. When we arrived on Sunday they had a table cleared and were ready for us. The food was fantastic! I got the Harvest Benedict (sauteed spinach and a veggie burger with a poached egg smothered in hollandaise). As a vegeterian I like to see stuff like this on the menu, creative veggie fare. The homefries were crispy and well done, and the hollandaise was rich and creamy. The bloody mary bar was a pretty cool idea as well. We had 2 each and enjoyed switching it up a little with the mixers and the various toppings. Nice job with pickles and the blue cheese stuffed olives! The wait staff was super friendly and extremely kind. When we got our bill we were told that Joey had gotten our first round of drinks! Way to go Cain's!

While we prefer to sit at the bar we knew this would end up being a dining room trip based on the ongoing March Madness and the time we got there (Happy Hour). Our wait to be seated was really short and even the tables (rather than booths) feel roomy in the dining room. There are approximately 100 giant TVs inside between the bar and dining room. Well, ok, maybe not 100... but it's close maybe 97 TVs. This is a great place to watch whatever Sportball game your into, even in the dining room. \n\nAs soon as we were seated it started to really fill up. The place looks small but it fits a lot of people. While waiting for our waitress to come get our drink order I saw they used an online listing for the over 30 on tap craft beers. I love this because it allowed us to decide before she even got to us. They have a happy hour special of half price appetizers and Wednesday's are wing night. \n\nWe both ordered wings; mine boneless and his bone in (it's ok you can laugh, I'm 12 too). They took a while to come out due to how busy they were but they were so delicious. I was so happy with the food and how attentive our waitress was even though it was insanely busy.  \n\nThe food prices were great, the beer/drink options are awesome, the staff is friendly, and the interior is darker and cozy.

In very large part, because *everything* on the menu is made fresh daily.  This includes the ham, which the restaurant roasts every morning, complete with their own glaze.  The ham is cut from the bone to order, absolutely succulent, with a hint of clove.  The ham alone is reason enough to visit this place, but that isn't even the best offering.\n\nFirst are the pancakes, which includes specialty pancakes like apple and cinnamon and pumpkin - all of which (including buttermilk pancakes) are among the very best pancakes I've ever eaten.  The batter is prepared fresh every morning.  They have a slightly crispy exterior (plenty of butter and sugar in the batter) and fluffy center.  The apple and cinnamon pancakes are so good that I don't even eat them with syrup lest I mask the subtle flavors of cinnamon, cream, vanilla, and apples in the batter - a dusting of powdered sugar and a smear of half-melted butter is all that's needed to elicit an involuntary eyes-rolling-into-the-back-of-the-head expression of pleasure.  Seriously, these pancakes are DAMN good!\n\nSecond, all the egg entrees are fabulous!  Try the eggs benedict - that juicy ham, fresh cut from the bone, piled high atop two thick slabs of toasted Italian bread, topped with sunny-side-up eggs, and freshly prepared hollandaise.  Fantastic.  The omelets are great, and the \"jumbot\" - an \"everything in the prep table\" hash of stuff and scrambled eggs will satisfy the heartiest of diners.\n\nThe food here is really top-notch.  I realize that it's just a diner, but when I see and taste food this good, and this lovingly prepared, I want to see *everything* as perfect as most of the food.  With that in mind, I'd really like to see the restaurant offer real maple syrup - not the imitation \"table syrup\" stuff that I've seen them pour from a milk-carton-type paper container into the syrup bottles!  I'd gladly even pay a $1 premium to have real syrup with those delectable pancakes.  Also, I'd beg them to consider making their own biscuits, and possible serving them with a sausage (or sausage and herb?) gravy.  I'd *crawl* to the Dor-Stop from my home to eat there!\n\nThis place is PACKED on the weekends - be prepared to wait unless you get there very early.  The wait, however, will be worth it.  I eat here at least once nearly every weekend for breakfast.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}

The place is always packed but we were quickly seated and like many have stated before my coffee cup never fell below 3/4 full before it was refilled.\n\nNow lets get to the nitty gritty: the food.\n\nI got the pancake breakfast, usually a very simple and easy breakfast but when the breakfast came I was so impressed. The hotcakes are so different, some would even say magical. They are so fluffy and moist and complimented their super crispy bacon. I almost wanted to fold the entire breakfast up and eat a giant pancake eggarito. My mouth is watering thinking about it.\n\nMy girlfriend got the breakfast sandwich which was very well done. Their ham is so succulent and tender. They cut it off the bone at the Dor-Stop and is shows. The sandwich is a work of art and is the classiest breakfast sandwich I have ever seen. \n\nI recommend this place to anyone and will definitely come back to try some other types of pancakes. They are the best in the city.\n\nOh and try the potato pancakes, they will rock your world.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}

Okay, maybe the best.  I can't say the best for sure, though, because I haven't made my way through then entire list of breakfast places around the city.  But I'm working on it, though.  (I even have a spreadsheet.)\n\nI've had everything from the pancakes to the eggs burrito to daily specials.  I always know it's going to be delicious, I'm going to struggle to finish the portions and I will leave happy both with my meal and the bill.  I'd like to be able to recommend one thing over another, but I really can't.  Everything I've eaten at The Dor-Stop has been a great and satisfying breakfast.  The pancakes are sweet, the bacon is always crisp and I can't find anything bad to say about an omlet special that includes bologna (aka jumbo).  \n\nI guess my best recommendation has nothing to do with menu items: go on a weekday.  Weekends this place is hopping and there will likely be a wait.  Sure, it will be worth it, but if you can swing by early on a weekday you won't have to and the food will be just as good.  A friend of mine will call me now when she has to take her car to the dealership on West Liberty Avenue because she knows I will take her to the Dor-Stop.  It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy to share one of my happy places with a friend so it can be one of her happy places, too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}

I kid you not. Guy Fieri hyped the right place.  It is hands down the best diner in the universe.  Actually, I don't know that for sure, but I dare you to find a better diner anywhere in the United States.\n\nThe food here is made with love and that's what makes it stand out out. You can taste the love in every single bite.  The staff of this family-owned restaurant run like a well-oiled machine, used to the crazy crowds that come here every day to blow their diets and binge.  This was all a girl could ask for on a cheat day.\n\nI had Vicki's Italian Jumbot but with Guy Fieri's twist on it, making it a little more spicy. It was more than enough for Jim and I to share.  We also shared the fantastic pumpkin pancakes. They do not need syrup at all. So fluffy, so delicious and gut-busting.  Why do I have to live in D.C?  I would be here every weekend for brunch.  There is nothing like this place over here..wahhh!   This place is great for sharing so order different dishes and eat them family style. The portions are gigantic and unforgiving! \n\nAnyway, do not come to Dor-Stop thinking they have become over-commercialized because  of their appearance on the Food Network. They have not. They are the same family-owned established where you can get no nonsense  service and absolutely amazing food.  If you are in Pittsburgh, run don't walk to Dormont and grab a seat at Dor-Stop.

I had to fend off T who kept getting samples. :) I also tried T's apple cinnamon pancakes which had dollops of apple pie filling and just the right amount of cinnamon.

Their menu has all of the classics including their signature pancakes, omelets, french toast and eggs cooked to suit.\n\nMy coffee cup and water were kept full and while sipping on my caffeinated beverage, my meal came.  The Dor-Stop produced my order of two eggs over medium, and two large banana, chocolate chip pancakes.

They have the perfect texture, the perfect taste, the perfect look, the perfect smell... need I go on?  The eggs were good too, I don't want to leave them out, but what egg is going to win again the battle of pancakes v eggs?\n\nBreakfast Breakdown,\n\nThe Food: Delicious!\nThe Value: I believe my two egg combo was $7.99. Breakfast for four with coffee was close to $40. That's not too bad.\nThe Experience:  It's a small restaurant full of happy people! I happened to glance at the table next to us  and saw the breakfast burrito.  It's massive!\nWould I return?: Why, yes. I wish I lived closer so I could eat them every Sunday.\n5 stars?: I've been to a restaurant that claimed to have the best pancakes in the world.  They were wrong. The Dor-Stop has the best pancakes and for not claiming to have the best, they get 5 stars, because these pancakes were heaven sent!\n\nBonus game!: How many times were pancakes and breakfast mentioned in this review?

The eggs perfect sunny side up (I love it when you stab the yolk and it runs all over the food). I liked that they used some kind of toast instead of regular English muffins. The hollandaise sauce was rich and buttery, maybe a little bit too rich.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}

Sure enough, when they came out, I thought \"okay this is a decent amount\"... and then I proceeded to take my first bite.\n\nThese are the fluffiest, most incredibly good and filling hot cakes that I've ever had! I don't know how they do it! I made it through 2 1/2 of them before I hung my head in defeat. But it didn't matter, because I was in my happy place. These cakes are absolute heaven, and if you haven't tried them yet, you are missing out!\n\nI never thought I could get emotional about food, but this is one of those times. I recall my mom once craving crabs from a crab shack in Ft Lauderdale for over 10 years after having them once. I feel like Dor-Stop pancakes will be the equivalent for me.

While I'm thrilled to see Bob and Vicky's crew thriving, I do have to say that I miss being able to actually walk-in on a Saturday or Sunday without a line around the block.\n\nIrregardless, when you're looking for unique spins on traditional diner fare, this is your joint.\n\nThe pancakes are all fantastic.  I've had every combination on the menu and then plenty more (they'll usually grant a request if they have the ingredients and they usually run a weekend special).  I highly suggest the apple walnut, banana chocolate chip, the oatmeal raisin, and most importantly...  PUMPKIN (the best in town).\n\nLori's Raspberry French Toast is the obligatory first dine, just stay away from the other iterations that aren't first coated in corn flakes prior to landing on the griddle.\n\nThe jumbots, eggs benedict, and potato pancakes all also represent fantastic choices.  If you have a choice of meat, hands down get the \"ham off the bone\".\n\nOne other key note...  Bob, Vicky, and their daughter Lori go out of their way to make people happy.  They always bring samples out to those waiting for a seat and offer coffee to hold people over when it's cold out.\n\nIf you're running solo or with one in tow, I recommend you check to see if there are spots at the bar (first come first serve).", "type": "review", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}

Getting its name from the bedroom community it's located in, Dormont, it benefits from a charming mini-downtown area immediately around it, as well as lots of brick houses, although some have seenbetter days. \n\nDor-Stop is diner chic through and through, serving the breakfast and lunch crowds only. Nic nacs and local sports teams' placards adorn the walls, as well as a proudly displayed signed poster from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives after that show's stop here. A mix of booths, tables and a few counter seats could cram several dozen people in.\n\nYou don't have to do any research about what's popular here, just take a look at a good chunk of the menu or what the person next to you is eating: the hotcakes. With a dozen options, there's a lot of choice and they're all tempting. I settled on the apple walnut hot cakes with sausage on the side. We didn't have to wait long but it felt like a while hungrily watching all the delicious looking food come out of the open kitchen or sitting in the window.\n\nOnce in front of me, I was staring at three thick hot cakes with apples chunks and walnuts cooked into them and topped with icing sugar, along with two sausage rounds. The hot cakes were utterly fantastic, with a pleasing denseness but with just enough air in them to keep them from being chewy, The apples were cooked perfectly, soft but not mushy, and along with the walnuts added some texture. I was initially disappointed that the sausage came in round form instead of links as they tend to be drier, but these were nicely browned and still juicy, albeit a bit too greasy. \n\nMy girlfriend went for the lunch time food, getting the Chick 'O' Philly hoagie  which came with sliced chicken breast, sauteed mushrooms, onions and green peppers, tomato lettuce and Swiss cheese. It was a winning combination of ingredients and the thick bun made for a even heftier sandwich, and as a good sandwich should be it was greater than the sum of its parts. The fries it came with were a solid entry - lightly browned, thick cut but still nice and crispy. \n\nOn a return trip, I went with the plain hot cakes and they were just as good as the apple walnut ones, a sign of great fundamentals when you're doing something as seemingly basic as a hot cake. Kudos. \n\nService was friendly and attentive, with a ton of coffee top ups. You'll be challenged to get past half empty in your cup at any point in the meal.\n\nDor-Stop seemed like just a convenient spot to fuel up for a day of tourism but turned out to be a damned good spot with memories of its own: the best pancakes I've ever had.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}

I've had their banana oatmeal, pumpkin and banana pancakes. All amazing and HUGE. Their Italian jumbot was also featured on the show- incredible and spicy which is what I really liked about it. Their hot chocolate is amazing- sooo chocolatey and just the best hot coco around. \n\nThe service is that of a typical diner, so nothing amazing.

The pancakes were so, so delicious. They were thick and dense, but weren't too thick that they were difficult to eat. The sausage patties were cooked just right. They were juicy, and greasy, and simply amazing. The lyonnaise potatoes were a nice addition. They are my favorite type of potato. My boyfriend got Guy's version of the jumbot. It was loaded with hot sausage, potatoes, eggs and peppers. He loved it, and so did I! \n\nThe atmosphere of Dor-Stop is that of a typical diner. Various memorabilia and other types of old-time posters adorn the walls, which makes for a very comfortable feel. The service was great for being so busy, and we only had to wait a short amount of time for our food. \n\nI definitely plan on coming back here as soon as possible to try the other great options on the menu.

It was several years ago that I first came upon The Dor-Stop, and since then my breakfast lifestyle has been forever changed.\n\nI know this will sound like blasphemy coming from a Dor-Stop convert, but I hate pancakes. I just don't understand them, they are odd and moist, and nowhere near as delicious as waffles. I came into The Dor-Stop the first time with this mindset, and am now forever changed. \n\nThe Dor-Stop's hotcakes are delicious and almost cake-like. They aren't thin crepes, or undercooked globs of batter, but instead sweet, fluffy treats that come in a plethora of flavors. I personally endorse oatmeal walnut, but others love the banana or pumpkin (when in season). I recommend ordering the \"Egg Combo\": 2 hot cakes, eggs, and bacon/sausage. Go all out, you deserve it. \n\nOn a recent visit, I also discovered the french toast menu, which has caused me to forsake my hot cake habit. The french toast is almost deep fried and covered in this raspberry yogurt. It is a can't miss item on the menu, rivaling that of the hot cake. When pumpkin french toast is a special on the menu, I suggest you run to The Dor-Stop and taste a little of heaven. \n\nI've also sampled various items from the lunch menu with no complaints. The Rachel and Ruben are especially tasty if you feel like bypassing the breakfast menu. \n\nThis place is truly heaven in Dor-Stop.

But hey, they definitely deserve it! In fact Dor-Stop is so good that I came here two days in a row a couple weekends ago - once for a sit-down meal, and once to get a meal to-go just so I could try a second item on the menu.\n\nI actually hadn't eaten at Dor-Stop in years until earlier this month - their hours and my schedule don't tend to mesh. But one afternoon I just happened to be using 1/2 a vacation day, so I came with a family member. Since it was the middle of the day on a Friday, the place was fairly empty, which I definitely didn't mind - this place is pretty cozy and so it gets cramped quickly during weekend dining rushes.\n\nBut on to the food, the important part of this review! My dining companion ordered a salad - complete with French fries, 'cause that's how we do salads in Pittsburgh - and I ordered their Feta Burger. Sure, their Raspberry stuffed french toast caught my eye...but Feta burger! How often do you see that on the menu? And I loved that burger, by the way - it was well cooked and the toppings blended perfectly (I snagged a few mushrooms from my companion's salad which made it even better), and definitely felt like good diner food. I left feeling super happy with my meal.\n\nBuuuuut...the next day I still couldn't get that french toast of my mind. I just couldn't. So I called in an order for pick-up - good thing I did, too, because there was nowhere to sit when I came in! Saturdays are definitely jam-packed here, understandably so. Well, I got my food, brought it home, and proceeded to devour it. Just, YUM! Seriously - that french toast is a MUST!\n\nIf I was going to complain about anything it would be that the seating really isn't the most comfortable on the planet, buuuuut...I can't hold it against them. I just can't. Not after that french toast. See you next time, Dor-Stop!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}

Maybe I am the odd one out in all of this but I cringe when I see a salad served with breakfast foods. I go out to breakfast to eat unhealthy, artery clogging deliciousness. If I wanted to concern myself with veggies I would stay at home and save my money and eat at home. Anyways, their eggs benedict consists of the diner's ham off the bone, two eggs, mancini's bread and a pool of delicious hollandaise. There is no stinginess when it comes to this meal. Everything is heavy handed. In addition to the huge eggs benedict, there is a beautiful mountain of potatoes that comes with it. Everything about this dish is how it should be.

Given that we were headed out to South Park for a hike, and we wanted to get brunch beforehand, I suggested we take the opportunity to try the Dor Stop, since Dormont was on the way and I'd heard great things about their brunch (not to mention that they were on DDD!).  In hopes of beating the late-rising rush, we arrived at around 10:30, and it worked out perfectly, since we only had to wait about 15 min. to be seated.\n\nOnce we were seated, we were promptly greeted and given menus by one of the waitstaff.  Having checked out the reviews ahead of time, I knew I wanted to try the raspberry French toast.  I mentioned the other items that had been featured on DDD--and that people enjoy, based on the reviews--to CM, and he decided to go with the famous pumpkin pancakes (yeah, that's what I call them, rather than hot cakes--so sue me!).  Our order was taken promptly, and was delivered to our table about 10 min. after ordering.  My French toast looked exactly like I expected, based on the pictures--it consisted of four toast points covered with raspberry sauce, and drizzled with raspberry jam.  The toast was perfectly crispy, and the sauce was delicious and flavorful--it was everything I could want in a sweet brunch item!  However, I did find the name of this dish a bit misleading, since the toast itself wasn't actually stuffed, unlike other versions I've tried before.\n\nI tried a bite of CM's pumpkin pancakes, and they were also delectable--unlike most pancakes I've had, they were quite moist even without any syrup, and definitely included real pumpkin, rather than just pumpkin pie spice, like many pumpkin items I've tried.  The butter added some welcome savoriness to the sweetness of the pancakes, and a bit of syrup added some additional moistness.  Since both of our dishes came with a breakfast meat, we ordered bacon (duh!), which provided us with a supply of umami flavor when we wanted a break from the sweetness of our entrees.\n\nOverall, CM and I were very pleased with our experience at the Dor Stop.  Our total check, which included a glass of milk for me in addition to our entrees, came to around $20, which we felt was quite reasonable in light of the quality of the dishes.  Service was friendly and efficient, and the ambiance was cheerful and light-filled--exactly what I'd expect in a diner.  Even though we both felt a tad out of place among the clientele, which was almost completely white families with young children (very different than your typical East End eating establishment, which is what we're both accustomed to), we felt welcome.  Without a doubt, the Dor-Stop offers one of the best breakfasts in PGH, and doesn't disappoint for down home diner goodness!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}

I LOVE Bado's. It's right down the street from one of my old schools, so I have a lot of fond memories of eating here once a week or so with my mom during the school's lunch break. \n\nWith that in mind, because I often come here craving pizza and I was a child patron, I tend to just forget that, oh yeah: they have a full menu, and they serve alcohol as well. Not only do they serve alcohol, but my family has actually purchased six-packs from the bar since Bado's is easier to get to than a beer distributor. I think they have a decent but obviously not expansive beer selection if we're taking the time to buy and carry a six pack home.\n\nAs for the food? No complaints. The pizza is delicious, and Bado's also has a bunch of other meal options like sandwiches, soups and salads, so you're sure to find something here. All of my personal favorite dishes here are cheesy and come with standard but still tasty sauces that just complete the meal. One of my favorite things from Bado's is actually their calzones, which are enormous and yet, oddly enough, \"light.\" Not light in calories, but light in the amount of grease and oils in the meal. This, of course, is compared to take-out chains, so I'm sure it's still way too much and not that good for you. But still, I've always felt that their calzones have the perfect blend of toppings, sauces, and so forth, and they're borderline divine - the perfect local splurge.\n\nJust keep in mind, Bado's is popular and it gets crowded. Fast. Be prepared for a wait or try to show up during slow hours, i.e. not right after work - especially on a Friday. But really, other than that, I can't complain about this place. In fact, just talking about it makes me crave pizza...mmmmmm.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qemCNgjeYGcFsRwxW9x4xw"}

Anything in the beer cave (I thik there are over 1000 brands!) can be taken over to the eating area, and there is a rapid chiller to cool down your unrefrigerated bottles.  There is also a large walk in fridge to grab beers as well.\n\nThe eat-in area serves a variety of quite good bar food, although I've only had the hot dogs once or twice.  The fries are great, and the draft selection in this area is awesome as well.  \n\nOverall, go here if you want a great beer selection and good bar food.

In VA I worked at a wine and beer bar, where we served and I tasted some of the best beers in the world.  And in VA we don't have absurd old beer and wine control laws, meaning our access to reasonably priced, intelligently stocked beer is much higher than pittsburgh.  That said, the best selection of beer I've found in this city has been at D's.  You will find a number of american craft brews, trappist ales, etc.  The only problem is the price...  which is solvable.  D's has a great system, if you buy a bottle of beer to take out of the restaurant they take 1 dollar off the bottle.  This dollar off doesn't matter when you consider how small a normal bottle is, but when you look at the larger bottles it does.  The prices for their larger bottles with the dollar off are not much higher than you would pay in a specialty beer shop in a less regulated state.  The only problem is that you have to commit to drinking three or four beers instead of one - I'm not really seeing the issue with that, but I'm sure someone will.  \n\nAlso, I've never eaten here, because hot dogs are generally not good.  Furthermore, I'm not sure why anyone would go to a hot-dog joint and expect good service.  So ignore anyone talking about hot-dogs and come here for the beer. Finally, parking sucks there's a lot of very busy restaurants and businesses on the same street, so expect to walk a little.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g"}

I've been coming to D's for about 3...D's is one of the many gems of Regent Square.  It really is the place (if you go often enough) that everyone really does know your name....as well as what you like. Or in my case...the only beer I actually like enough to drink more than once.  The bartenders are all amazing people and really make you feel comfortable. The service is great and they are always ready with a recommendation for any newbies. All it takes is a few questions and they have a few suggestions. I have a friend who loves Magic Hat, and when finding out that D's didn't have it on tap that night, was totally bummed. When she told the bartender that she usually drinks MH, he made a recommendation. I was not at all surprised (she was) when she loved what he'd suggested. \n\nYour trip to D's wouldn't be complete without trying something from their extensive menu. Their hot dogs are great (and for those of you who are vegetarian, they have awesome veggie dogs), the pizza is delicious, and if you're craving wings, there's no better place to go (try the Jamaican jerk...they're my favorite!).\n\nOkay, so you're thinking good beer, good food, good service, what more could they possibly offer?  DON'T LEAVE YET! Before you head home, hit the beer cave and take some to go. If you can't find something to drink here, you may just be too picky (or a non drinker, which is totally okay, but I would suggest the root beer they have on tap before you give up.) \n\nMy sister and I stopped in over the weekend for some pizza. We had the pleasure of meeting Dino, the owner. He's incredibly friendly and just a nice guy ( he bought us both a drink!). We chatted for a bit, and he moved on to greet some other patrons. I think it says a lot about  any place when owners and employees alike can be found there on a day off. \n\nIf you're visiting Pittsburgh and anywhere close (heck...even if you aren't close) head to D's and grab a taste of a great local bar", "type": "review", "business_id": "2X5G4Ujq0s4Wfn4TC7gX0g"}
