I have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. Apparently, we were out of luck. I've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no \"pies\". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that \"they were out\". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I'd probably avoid this place like the plague. Speaking of the plague, I suppose we should thank Mr. Surly for inspiring us to walk out. I only have two bathrooms at my house and would've been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WETE_LykpcnrC1sFcQ5EGg"}

After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers.

There were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said \"yep\" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said \"What do you want me to do\"?\n\nMy friend said \"An apology would be a good start\" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said \"Get out and don't come back\" ???????? Are you kidding????\n\nMy friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. \n\nThat being said, we left and went back to 131 East, where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.\n\nThere are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J's is no longer the only game in town.  Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!!  Do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of Papa J's.

But after we ordered, what really got me angry was that the food took a VERY long time to arrive. We had 2 kids with us and we ordered 2 kids meals, and had asked for those to be brought sooner. After about 25-30 minutes of nothing, I went to the servers (who were just NOT paying attention to us anyway - the main server's name for our table was Angel) and asked where our meals were. One checked with another, who then informed me that they were working on it. \nWhat made me even angrier is that they tried to downplay everything, telling me that it had only been 5 minutes. Then one of the servers (manager?) tells me that \"ok, may be it's been 10 minutes, but it's coming\". Then I hear some of the servers talking about our orders. The same gentleman then came to our table, sat down next to me and told me that it's only been 10 minutes and that they were working on our order, and tried to give me some explanation about why that's not really a long time at all. It was clearly almost half an hour or longer by that time. \nThe food finally arrived about 10 minutes after that. But the food came cold. \nWe were so HUNGRY by that point, we just ate whatever we could. Neither Angel nor anyone else came to top up our drinks even ONCE.

Wow. \nAfter about an hour and half at the restaurant, we all just shook our heads and left. \n\nI have written to them on their website, and will see if they follow up. \n\nWe have vowed NEVER to go to this restaurant again.

It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them.

Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. \n\nWas it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks.

Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.\n\nI started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think?) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two \"pork\"-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.\n\nNext came my \"lunch-portion\" order of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). \n\nAt the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang's. \n\nOn my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.\n\nGlaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all.\n\nI've had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The \"lunch-portion\" cost was $9.95.\n\nAt The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.\n\nThe service was decent. However, lesson learned. One and done. Never going back to PF Changs.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JDDeaNfb0JXD1NbznSIC9g"}

But the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. When pointed out to the waitress, she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! How crude! \n\nSpoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. \n\nWhen I asked the manager about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - \"Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll.\" - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says. Shame on you Manager for lying! Instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu!\n\nNot only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. \n\nI am never going to come back to any Eat N Park location ever again, and will never recommend one to any of my friends either.

Well they didn't fry anything long enough so it was soggy and all the breading was falling off everything. My drink was never refilled. Even worse, we noticed ants crawling all over the window sill next to us!\n\nHalf an hour later the server decides to ask \"You gettin' dessert?\" We ordered slices of pie to go. My \"slice\" of strawberry pie was two strawberries and a few crumbs of crust. We went up front to pay to find one lady at the register (who seemed to be the sole adult employee) counting her drawer and nobody else in sight. We stood there and evil eyed her for a few minutes and she finally took a break from her conversation to say someone would be with us.

The hostess then took us to a table inside the restaurant.  Not wanting to be rude, I asked if they were not putting anyone outside for some reason... She said the person who took our name didn't indicate that we wanted to sit outside (however, I watched her write \"patio\" next to our name).  We were then led outside and told to sit where ever we wanted... Because it was still basically empty... \n\nFinally happy to be seated, we waited another 10 minutes or so for our waitress to come.  She asked if we were ready to order both our meals and drinks so we did.  It took another 10 minutes to get our drinks which we quickly drank because we were thirsty from riding.  We were able to get a refill before we got our food since it took over 40 minutes from the time we ordered it.  The waitress came back one more time after we were done eating and I asked it I could talk to someone about how long everything took but she did not seem interested.  No apology.   Nothing.  She simply said that sometimes they aren't told when someone is seated outside.  Maybe that would explain the initial wait but why the terrible service after she clearly knew we were there?\n\nThis Eat'n Park is a joke.  Extremely slow service and a rude waitress on top of it.  The food was ok, but paying for that meal made me feel like I was being robbed.  A group of people at the table next to us walked out after waiting 10-15 minutes for a waitress to acknowledge them.

I'm not sure what they think they are attempting to pass for Crab Rangoon's here. These monstrosities were completely inedible. \n\nThe only thing they didn't mess up on our order was the rice. It tasted and looked like rice. When we called to complain I was told the restaurant said they did nothing wrong and wouldn't do anything about the situation. Awesome. Now my stomach is upset from the few bites I took.\n\nI'm pretty sure this place should change it's name to \"Inedible Slop\" because it's far from \"Tasty.\"", "type": "review", "business_id": "Y2p07YEC8xOsYTHWf0UxiA"}

Olive Garden seems like fine dining compared to this place. \n\nYou can already tell how bad your experience is going to be when they give you the complimentary bread that looked like it was bought from a convenience store. Not the crusty Italian bread. The generic Giant Eagle whole wheat bread that I buy regularly tasted 10x better. This so-called Italian bread came with pre-packed airline butter. No dipping oil with herbs and spices. Then we had the wedding soup which looked like it's been sitting in the kitchen since this morning and was just reheated. \n\nWe had the appetizer platter, which was composed of allegedly banana peppers, calamari, and breaded zucchini. It was 95% breading. I can barely taste any calamari or zucchini. The worst was the marinara sauce, which tasted like it came from a can. Again, no herbs and spices. \n\nFor the entree, I ordered rigatoni and my fiance had baked ziti. The only way I can describe the sauce is: Think of diluted Ragu. My pasta was also overcooked and there was no flavor whatsoever so I had to put so much parmesan cheese. I couldn't even taste garlic in it. What kind of Italian food has no garlic? The baked ziti was overcooked and dry, and it was tasteless according to my fiance. \n\nService was slow, but there was only one waitress in the restaurant. I requested warm water and it took about 40 minutes until she finally served it. She was generally nice and probably embarrassed for serving such crappy food.\n\nHow much did it cost us? $50, including tip.\n\nThis restaurant was probably good back in the day.

There were only two other tables with guests, one of which had empty plates on the table during this entire experience. After what seemed like forever, my husband got up to find a server. He literally walked around the restaurant to find someone, but couldn't. He then tried to ask the bartender, but she was just as elusive. When he finally found a server,  she acted totally shocked that we were there. Maybe if someone had been doing their job, they wouldn't be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurant.\n\nShe came to our table, got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order. When we said no she said she would be back. We could see her chit chatting with another server, but again, couldn't get her attention to come back to take our order. After another ten minutes of waiting for her to return, we put a few dollars on the table for my soda and we left. We ordered a pizza at a local shop and picked it up on our way home.\n\nTwenty-five minutes passed and we only get drinks? Such a waste of time. It took us 20 minutes just to make the drive there, 25 of waiting, and another 20 to get home. That's over an hour of our evening completely wasted which left us starving after a hard days work.

You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.  They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo.  \n\nI chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice.  It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.\n\nI paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave.

I bear the friendly people of Pizza Parma no ill will.\n\nBut their pizza was remarkably terrible.\n\nWent there, hungry, a bit past midnight, looking for a little something before going home to sleep. They don't have slices--this seems to be a (terrible, stupefying, egregious) trend in these parts. Fine. The smallest pizza, a \"personal\" pie, costs $7 and is 7\" in diameter. The cashier and I agree that that's a very small amount of pizza, and since I'm hungrier than one and one half mouthsful, I get a \"small,\" which is 10\". I add a mushroom topping. I pay my $11.21 and wait.\n\nThere are two seating options inside the store: a small wooden bench, and two fold up chairs around a little table. Conveniently, they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing, and they'd also elected to fold up the two folding chairs, probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs. So I waited outside the store on a bench.\n\nThe friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready. I took it outside, sitting in the cold to eat it, thinking, \"I hope this $11 pizza is pretty good.\" Opened up the box, saw how pitifully small a 10\" pizza is, and started eating.\n\nLet me say something about pizza: if you have decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, and a hot oven, you can make a passable pizza. I will eat it and think, \"well this isn't the best pizza I've ever had but it's fine.\" That is not what I thought when I ate Pizza Parma's pizza. I thought, \"it would be too rude and insulting to ask for my money back. I'll just try to eat as much of this as I can.\"\n\nI ate three out of the six \"slices.\" (One sixth of a 10\" pizza is a total of *25/6 = 13 square inches. That sounds like a lot of pizza, but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza.) I couldn't stand to eat more than half. The mushrooms were fine; I fished them out and ate them. The cheese was actually terrible; it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance. The crust was poofy and not crusty.\n\nAshamedly, I threw half of a pizza away tonight. Folks, I am not a food destroyer. I eat things I don't like, and expired foods, because I don't want to waste. It takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing away.\n\nWent home, made some eggs, and guess what? The terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago? It's still in my mouth. I'm not making this up.\n\nI know there's good pizza around here. Ordered two back to back slices at Spak Brothers--delicious! Tasty! Reasonable price!

Did they use the tea pot as an ash tray?  \n\n[first visit: 3 stars] + [second visit: -5 stars] = [ -2 stars]", "type": "review", "business_id": "tvXTHj9V5sgRoeVJW_FiTg"}

Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can't miss option...well, sometimes things don't turn out quite as you expect - almost everything that transpired from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was a failure.\n\nWhen our server, a young woman named Amanda L who would prove quite inept and inefficient from start to finish, finally did arrive our menus were delivered with a brief hello before she wandered away - another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never even offered.  When Amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed.  With my mom and sister opting for the two-course Gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our water.\n\nWaiting approximately 10 minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter - a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cow's milk butter - decent, but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at Eleven.  After this point we would not see another staff member for 30 minutes...well, we would see them, they just wouldn't be walking anywhere near our table - instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the bar...I'll note that my water glass remained empty for greater than 15 minutes.\n\nFinished with our first courses approximately 10 minutes would pass - long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our four-top - before Amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plates...we'd not see her again until 15 minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be \"right out.\"  While I guess she didn't define \"right out,\" what this actually meant was \"in 25 minutes.\"  Starting first with my mother's combo - Jumbo Lump Crab, pepper bacon, avocado, radish sprouts, on a paesano bun and Orecchiette Pasta with grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream. While the sandwich may not be memorable, the pasta was actually quite impressive.  Using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweet/savory m\u00e9lange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice match.\n\nVastly less well done than my mother's plate would be my sister's option - the Grilled Vegetables, portobello, zucchini, eggplant, arugula, chickpea hummus, on baguette and Maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, fontina, walnuts.  Beginning with the sandwich, the bite I had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency - too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly.  Moving on to the pasta - we all tasted it, but I'm still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting - it tasted like watery cheese...no spice, no salt, and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes.  For the first time in the meal Amanda actually opted to check on us approximately 10 minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else - more Orcchiette.\n\nFor my main course I received a simple side salad-fresh greens, crispy onion strings, and a pleasant vinaigrette.  The salad, of course, was served alongside Elysian Fields Lamb \"Mac and Cheese\", tubetti pasta, mascarpone, cheddar, Pecorino-Romano, and bread crumbs.  Piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent Macaroni and Cheese, but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added little.\n\nCompleting our mains approximately 110 minutes after entering Casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty plates-a different ancillary server this time.  With my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leaving-by the time Amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted 2:05 and I skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding, carrot cake, and panna cotta with \"just the bill.\"\n\nSettling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved - in reality Amanda may have actually be the worst server I've encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last 2 years.  I will note that when I wrote to Big Burrito was met by a (seemingly) sincere apology without excuses - the Manager stated things don't' normally happen like that and he'd be sure the issue was addressed.  He closed with \"I hope you will join us again.\" I will not.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2SwC8wqpZC4B9iFVTgYT9A"}

I thought it'd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu, but it was hard, dry, and chewy. Hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate... But that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy. Anything will taste better drenched in gravy. We think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water. On top of all this service wasn't the greatest. I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)I wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal. Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food. I've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates.

In that it does some things right, but none of the important things.  It has a decent sized shop with large windows and its bright, so that's good.  They have good music, but unfortunately we were seated right below one of what looked like two speakers in the place.  Its a large restaurant so in order to make it the right volume for people far away from the speaker it has to be too loud for the people close to the speaker.  I know the trade-offs of sound systems all too well.  If only there was a way to solve this problem like... just riffing here... more speakers at a lower volume?\n\nThey had a greatest hits of the thrift store type of decor and the standard shitty artists selling their paintings like at every coffee house you've ever been to.  They include coffee/tea/juice/whatever in the price of the brunch because, like everyone, I hate choices too and I definitely wanted at least one of those.  I'm looking at the menu and its a vegan/veggie place so we're never going to be good friends but I'd like to think that there's something that looks halfway decent but it all looks awful.  There are two Tex-Mex-Ranchero breakfast dishes... that's at least one too many; and there's only like eight choices which sounds like plenty as a number but I assure you it was not enough here.\n\nI go with the Egg Frittata as my least bad option and it ends up tasting mostly flavorless but with a distinct stale note.  It comes with a salad that is not bad, but who wants a salad for breakfast.  As we're leaving the waiter, who's been fine the whole time, asks us where we're from and my girlfriend answers \"D.C.\"  The waiter replies, \"Oh, I'm sorry about that.\"  Now, neither of us is actually born in the D.C. area, nor do I even particularly like living there.  So I'm not personally offended, but I'm not sure if someone from or living in Pittsburgh has solid footing to talk the business about Washington D.C. or almost any other large city.  Its not like property values in Pittsburgh are indicating that everyone's clammoring to live there, whereas in Washington D.C., they are.\n\nI was not enjoying the restaurant before that, but this kid actually threw me to straight up hating it.

Parking in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to impossible on a busy Saturday night; the diner should be prepared to walk a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park.  The greatest drawback is that the restaurant is tiny and the seating so tight that at our table, it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by, which happened repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery.  No other table offered a much better situation and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived, 6:45 p. m. The online menu boasts of a daily vegetarian and vegan special entree, but there was no such entree on this night.  There was only one non-meat item on the small menu, ravioli.  Our gracious server, Ramon, said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it, and that was what we did.  The restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages, a nice convenience and savings for the diner.  A small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rock-hard butter.  My mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion, served piping hot, which was great, but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces.  I would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup.  All of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty, average size portions.  All were served with a small amount of good, fresh vegetables. It would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server:  \"chicken maputo\nRoasted w/ piri piri & chocolate scented sauce\".  Does the average diner know what \"maputo\" and \"piri piri\" are? The lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing, served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream.  It was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories.  The gracious owner, Tony Pais, stopped at our table for a moment to greet us, a nice touch, and there were quality checks by a manager and Ramon.  I noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here, individuals whom I was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant.  Apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town.  The rest rooms are small, one-person facilities, naturally. An unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks, this for a tariff of $148 plus gratuity.  It is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an Automatic Teller Machine on site.  I imagine less than 1% of expensive restaurants today are cash only.  Cafe Zinho is a highly flawed restaurant, demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine.  If one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner, the diner might enjoy it: not us.\n\nI posted comments about the restaurant at its Facebook page, in which I noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable, and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $148 check.  An individual identifying himself as the manager, who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone, initially demonstrated rage, posting a message that I can go to the Oiive Garden the next time I dine out.  He later added with similar condescension that I can use a coupon and a credit card at The Olive Garden.  Later, he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments...along with mine.  He ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense.  I thanked him for the offer, but told him that one experience at Cafe Zinho was enough.  I had no intention of returning even if he had responded to my comments like a gentleman.", "type": "review", "business_id": "l_Wey2YC6NvVUIH8vTygGg"}

I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.\n\nAnd I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a \"what's going on here\" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.\n\nFinally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\n\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \"Uh-oh\".  The menu is huge with a number of \"slow-food\" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.\n\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \n\nSadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \"bacon\" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \"meat\".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \"The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\".\n\nThat's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.\n\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \n\nI'll never return.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ"}

It was two soggy fried chicken tenders from the deep fryer (not pan sauteed) over a bowl of bowtie pasta with shrooms and a sauce.

I had wanted to dine at Atria's for their Oktoberfest menu, and with Saturday night being the last of October, I made reservations for a friend and I at the PNC Park location.  Just to be sure, I called the restaurant and asked if the location was featuring the Oktoberfest menu.  The girl who answered assured me that they were. \n\nWhen we checked in, I again asked if they were doing the Oktoberfest menu, and again was assured they were although they did not give me the special menu which was sitting next to the regular menu at the host's podium.\n\nI didn't see any of the Oktoberfest specials listed on the menu, so I asked our server, a pleasant young man named Qwan about it.  He told me that the O specials were listed in a box on the lower left hand corner of the menu.  When I questioned the skimpy selection given there, he told me that they were not featuring the entire Oktoberfest menu on weekends at that location, but only a selection of appetizers and small plates.  He told me that all other locations were featuring the whole menu.   He seemed surprised and disinclined to believe me when I told him that that was not satisfactory, especially in light of the fact I had called to check and had been told that the special menu was being offered, and that we would be leaving. I got on Open Table and secured a reservation for dinner at their Wexford location, a half-hour's drive out of town. I didn't speak to anyone from the restaurant's management because we had to leave to make our reservation time at the Wexford location.\n\nIt is certainly any restaurant's right to serve whatever menu or part of a menu they wish, but they should also inform people when they call if they are not honoring the complete published special menu advertised.  \n\nThe food and service at the Wexford location were acceptable other than a spinach salad that arrived only after I had asked about it and without the warm sweet and sour dressing advertised on the menu.  They had also run out of the apple strudel that was on the menu, but that's always a chance you take on a popular menu item.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Z101WZaISochG6g7tI2ZVw"}

The following is an email that I sent to the owner, it will shed a little light as to why I feel this way...I will also share his response, and what ultimately became of the situation. I know this one is long winded, but you should be forewarned about giving them your money!\n\nI have been to your bar many times, and I have had both good and less than average experiences, but this past Saturday was terrible! My girlfriend and I came to have some dinner around 9 pm. We knew it would be crowded due to the Penguin game, and that wasn't a problem. When we arrived, there were no seats at the bar or tables available anywhere. We decided to have a beer and wait. After the game was over, some tables opened up so we sat in an empty booth in the back and waited. After about 5 minutes, a waitress came over, cleaned our table, and made notice of the fact that we still had drinks. Sadly, this was the last time that she ever came to our table. We placed our closed menus at the end of the table...nothing, we put our empty glasses at the end of the table with the menus...nothing. We sat and waited for more than 15 minutes. All the while we were waiting, another group of four sat the table next to us, they were never given any attention. They got up and left after being completely ignored. I understand that the restaurant was busy, and that service and wait times may be impacted, but the way we were treated (or lack of being treated) was appalling. It was especially annoying to watch the server that initially cleaned our table giggling and carrying on with two other booths that appeared to be friends with her on the other side of the dining room and then when she was done she just casually walked over to another empty table picked up something off of it and went into the kitchen without even taking a look around the dining room. At this point we were disgusted and got up and left, I was annoyed and made mention of how awful the service in the back was to the doorman. The waitresses in the back were terrible and seemed to have no sense of urgency or seem to care about most of the customers, with the exception of the few tables that they were more interested in socializing with. This seems to be a problem, because on some of my past less than stellar experiences, the disappointment was again with the service from the back servers. On those occasions it was the same thing, they seemed to be more interested in being social butterflies than providing any sort of service. You don't need to improve your wait staff, you need to replace some of them, at least the people working the back dining room on this past Saturday, they were completely useless! Will I come back to your restaurant, I'm not sure. The food is good, but I work hard for my money, and I expect to receive more than good food in exchange for it. \n\nSincerely,\n Matt K.\n\nHere is the response that I got\n\nPlease give me a call (412)555-1212 to discuss the matter. I'm sorry & will make every attempt to make sure this doesn't happen again.\nThank you for making me aware of the situation.\nJoey DeMarco \n\nI promptly called him as soon as I got this email. It went to voice mail , so I left a message. That was it, the guy didn't even have the decency to return my phone call. It is amazing that this is how business owners expect to keep people coming through their doors and handing over their hard earned money.

Although she did refilled my coffee once, I barely see her stop by and there wasn't too many people in the diner is isn't likely she is occupied by that amount of customers.I think the waitress was rude because she never say thank you during the entire breakfast even when I tipped her. I should have known, I just feel like they treated me differently that's all. This review is based on my dinning experience and the service. Seriously if they mean business they should improve. Especially waitress was lack of enthusiasm. Do I want to come back? Never ever.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2Igiyhi82R8_QaaPplRmCw"}

Common issues I've come across include the lack of sauces when I've asked for them, overcooked food, and so much grease that the sandwich begins coming apart, AND after eating I begin to feel sick to my stomach.\n \nSorry, guys.

It was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese. \n\nWhile my food was really good, there were some issues with the other items ordered. Two of my guests cited that the wedding soup had a metalic taste to it while my other friend with the burger found a hair. Being a hairdresser and understanding that it does happen sometimes, she disregarded it and continued to eat her burger. Unfortunately, the hair did not stop there. Another guest found several hairs in their meal as well. We decided that we should let our waitress know. I stopped the waitress and explained how there was hair in two people's food. The waitress got upset and was very rude (it's not like we accused her of planting the hair herself). On top of this, she mistakenly took my burger and walked away with it, leaving the sullied food on the table. When she came back I told her that my burger was not one of the items with food on it and she instantly became defensive. At this point we asked for a manager (who never came) and insisted our meal get comped. Considering she threw out the only good food that we ordered, we didn't feel like that was asking too much. Luckily the waitress did not put up too much of a fight. \n\nI will never eat at Bado's again. A good cheese burger and a decent pie isn't enough when the staff can't even accept their own (human) mistakes.

When I asked to speak to the manager, he just shook his head sadly and offered us free desserts.  I told him that I didn't want to eat anything that came out of a kitchen that clearly showed that the people working in it simply didn't care - at all, and we didn't want to eat anything, not even the food sitting in front of us, and just wanted to pay our bill and leave.

I hate complaining like this. I really do. But sometimes, you just have to, ya know?\n\nTuesday evening I met a group of friends for a birthday dinner.  The reservation for our party of nine was for 7:00pm.  All but one of our party arrived prior to 7:00, but the hostess was curt in explaining that all party members needed to be present before we were seated, as our chef would be ready to begin meal preparation as soon as we were seated.  Fortunately, the final member of our party arrived shortly and we were seated at 7:05pm.  It was not until 7:40pm that first contact with our server was made. Without any apology for the delay she took our drink orders.  She (name withheld because I don't want to be rude) returned more than 10 minutes later with our drinks, but waited another 10-15 minutes after that to take our dinner orders.  As I was waiting I looked over at the table next to us, who were also clearly celebrating a child's birthday.  At one point the mother (I'm assuming) smiled at me and said, \"I hope you get out before midnight. We've been here over two hours.  We're taking our cake and getting out of here.\"\n\nUpon taking our orders, one of our guests explained that due to a shrimp allergy it was necessary to cook any shrimp ordered by our group in another area (a neighboring grill, etc.).  Our server said that she would have to ask the manager, who came to our table shortly thereafter.  When the manager arrived at the table my guest explained her allergy and his response was that it might be in her best interest to leave.  I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that he meant leaving the table, not the restaurant, but I'm not certain of this. Following this recommendation he mentioned that she could wait in the bar as the rest of us dined table-side.  I asked him why it was not an option to prepare the shrimp at a neighboring table, but he expressed concern that other customers may require the use of the other available tables.  I understand his point, but the restaurant was near-empty as the hour quickly approached 8:30pm.  Finally, he offered to prepare the shrimp portions of our meals in the kitchen.  I'm not sure why this wasn't initially mentioned as an option, but I'll leave it at that.  \n\nOur chef Tom eventually arrived at our table. He was very pleasant and efficient during the course of our meal preparation.  During his time at the table my Emperor's Salad was delivered, as were the majority of my table's sushi orders.  However, two of our guests that ordered sushi were not served at this time.  In fact, they were not served until a full 10 minutes after the rest of our party finished our meals.  At one point, they inquired about the delay to she-whose-name-shall-not-be-mentioned, who responded that they were \"waiting for the rice.\"  When she delivered their food there was not a single mention of the delay.  \n\nTwo hours and thirty+ minutes after we arrived at Benihana, we left.  From start to finish, the entire evening was a terrible experience.  It was ridiculous to the point that there was not even soap or toilet paper available in the restroom.  Were it not for the kindness and professionalism of Tom (and the awesome company of friends), the night would have been a complete waste.  \n\nMy final thought is this. The food was fine, but because I was feeling particularly piggish on this Tuesday evening, I enjoyed two California rolls from my stash of Costco sushi at home before departing for the restaurant. The difference between Costco's rolls and Benihana's...a toss up - just sayin.

We've always had to wait at least a half an hour to be seated, even when we've had reservations. In the past its been forgivable, mostly because its close to home for us, the food is okay (albeit a little pricey), and my Grandmother absolutely loves the entertainment of hibachi. But that all changed last night when we went out with a party of 8 for my and my mothers birthday. \n\nI made reservations two weeks in advance for our birthday dinner. When I called they were almost totally booked and only had a few spots left that evening. Our reservations were for 7:30. \n\nWe arrive a little early at 7:20 and I let the hostess know that we are there and she checks us in. Then we basically just wait and wait and wait. We notice the hostess turning people away, and we notice two tables who have been seated for about 30 minutes now haven't even gotten their soups or salads. By now its nearly 8 O'clock. Then my mother overhears the hostess telling someone that they are short staffed and the wait is going to be extremely long. By this point we've been waiting for 45 minutes. My sister takes a walk through the restaurant and notices there is only 1 hibachi chef working, but there are SEVEN tables seated, all waiting for food/drinks. So I ask the hostess how much longer before we are seated. She informs me that it will be at least another half an hour before we get a table, because two hibachi chefs and two kitchen chefs called off sick. It would be another hour after were seated before they would even start taking our food orders. \n\nThis is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. First of all, the hostess should have informed us when we arrived that they were short staffed and we would have a very very long wait. OR, the manager should have phoned people with reservations and asked if they could reschedule. Either way, we should have been informed instead of letting us stand in the lobby for an hour, not knowing that it would be another hour and a half before we would actually eat, on an evening when we had reservations. \n\nWe decided to call Ichiban to see if they could accommodate us. They told us we could walk right in and be seated immediately. As we were leaving we ran into a gentleman who was outside smoking who told us that his party had reservations for 6:30 and they still had not ordered their food! It was now about 8:20pm. \n\nOur first dinner at Ichiban actually turned out to be much better than our previous dinners at Benihana, so I don't think we'll ever be going back there. I think Ichiban will be our new hibachi restaurant of choice.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1vQLTKwmcmZXtNzfKEvMmA"}

We love Benihanas, but never again at this location.  From our experience with Hibachi type establishments we've always encountered great personalities, great service, and tasty food that left us wanting to come back for that experience.  Instead we left with a sour taste in our mouths and with about $60 less in our pockets.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1vQLTKwmcmZXtNzfKEvMmA"}

It was my granddaughter's 4th birthday and thought she'd get a kick out of a hibachi chef. Fist we wait 45 mins or so to be seated. The restaurant wasn't even half full. We chose the dinner portion instead of the lunch because by this time we were very hungry and the waitress said we would get larger portions. She lied. Our hibachi chef was absolutely horrible! He spoke so softly that you couldn't hear anything he said. He barely spoke and didn't put on any kind of show at all! Our 4 year old was so bored that she wanted to leave. The other party that was seated with us all ordered the lunch versions and they got more food! The chef mixed everything together so no one got a larger portion than anyone else. The only thing that we got instead of them was a half a slice of zuccini and a little bit of onions. None of us even like onions. My \"steak\" was at least 1/4 fat which the chef cut off and disposed of which didn't even leave enough for a small sandwich. By the time our main course was served our vegetables and rice were ice cold. We asked to speak to the manager who told us that they weigh the portions in the back before they bring them out to cook them. However like I said the chicken was all mixed together and at least 1/4 of my steak was complete fat and thrown out. The manager didn't seem to care at all about our situation. We paid almost $10 a meal extra for the \"dinner\" portion. He could have easily knocked it down to the \"lunch\" price, but he refused. After all this, we over heard another chef complaining that the place had new owners and everyone quit.  I for one will never, EVER, go back there and would suggest everyone who reads this to stay away. We feel completely cheated.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1vQLTKwmcmZXtNzfKEvMmA"}

I guess not, so we get the cookies - they are outstanding, as always, but not worth the trip. This whole \"adventure\" took a hour and half.

Little did we know that our group would discover exactly why this is the case during our visit. It's especially noteworthy that I came with a large group that made a reservation with specific instructions about what we wanted. Our evening plans had been made well in advance, and Soho knew - or should have known - exactly how many people would be in our party, and when we would arrive. Most of all, they should have known we had not only asked for a table to be ready, we had asked for water and very specific appetizers to be ready for our group, as we would be hungry after the event we enjoyed before the happy hour. \n\nWell, as you can probably guess from my rating, making a reservation and discussing and confirming our needs with the staff well in advance made absolutely no difference in the quality of our visit. In fact, I can summarize my entire visit here in two words: we waited.\n\nWe waited for them to confirm we had a table after we walked in at 7:15. We waited for the sever to come after they finally confirmed that yes, a reservation had been made. We waited for the server yet again after asking for drink menus. We waited for these drinks, and for water. And we waited for our pre-ordered appetizers. \n\nAbsolutely nothing arrived in a timely manner. In the 35 minutes that I waited with the group, all I got was a water. None of the pre-ordered appetizers even arrived while I was there, and many people waited 10 to 15 minutes for their other drinks. I was honestly astounded at how much the staff missed the mark with our reservations and requests. So I gave up, and left at 7:50 to find a better venue that was interested in providing me with a relaxing Friday night meal.\n\nAnd all of that was on a night where the place was mostly empty! I can't even imagine what the service must be like if it's actually busy - and I certainly won't be back to find out!", "type": "review", "business_id": "FtjvnLhh51ZBYEpKAARaFQ"}

It's like you have to be mediocre to have a restaurant inside a hotel.  I don't get it!  Wouldn't they WANT you to stay and spend money on their property?? \n\nNevertheless, this place in the Westin hotel is no different.  For starters, the place is sorely outdated.  The decorations look like they're straight out of an 80's music video.  I went with my mom, who asked me if the glass sculptures on the ceiling where Chihuly's.  I almost choked on my bread when she asked! \n\nI always go for sushi when it's on the menu at a fish place.  I can't get away from it, plus I need my weekly (or sometimes daily) fill of it!  So I ordered a spicy yellow tail roll and a ginger salad.  The spicy yellow tail was not spicy.  It had a side of \"spicy\" sauce.  I'm not too sure that qualifies it to be spicy with a dab of sauce.  The salad's ginger dressing was awful and watery.  I love ginger dressing when it's done right.  But it was not happening at this place! \n\nThe thing that really made me mad is that the place is overpriced to begin with.  My tiny yellow tail roll was more expensive ($7) than the fabu Penn Ave Fish Co ($5.50) rolls.  And DEF not as good!  My mom ordered a bowl of fish soup.  This \"bowl\" was a deep dish salad bowl and looked as if there was a small ladle size serving.  It was hardly halfway full.  That's all my mom had ordered for lunch.  It was pretty sad looking.  So she asked for a little more from the server.  The server said that's all she could give her because it was restaurant policy.  Now let me tell you....I've worked at restaurants.  I've witnessed the people who eat their ENTIRE meal, then say it was bad and want another one...and they get another one!  Now that's messed up!  Asking for a little more soup, that's supposed to be a BOWL but looks more like a spoonful is hardly too much to ask for. \n\nNeedless to say, I will NOT be back. There are WAY better fish places in the city to fill my belly with, hands down! Go to Penn Ave Fish Co, It's opened a new location right on Fifth Ave!

Thank God I didn't pay full price for this slop.  \n\nFirst, lets talk about the decor.  Others have commented about the outdated 80s look of the place. I concur.  The chairs are ridiculously heavy and uncomfortable.  And don't even get me started on the hideous glass constructions hanging from the ceiling.  \n\nSecond, let talk about the staff.  Unprofessional to say the least.  When we were waiting for our table, I witnessed the hostess yell at a man from across the restaurant, instead of walking up to him and guiding him to his party.  \"Hey Anthony, your party's over here!\"  Ridiculous. \n\nThis restaurant has an open kitchen, which is usually a good thing - but not when everyone's yelling at each other.  We were seated near the kitchen and, I'm not exaggerating, heard someone yell \"order!\" approximately every 30 seconds.  Staff yelled at each other from across the restaurant constantly.  I felt like I was on a playground.  \n\nOur waitress was a nice, sweet girl, and she did the best she could considering the environment she was in.  I have no complaints about her.  \n\nThe food, though... Jesus.  We started with the \"margarita shrimp cocktail\".  Imagine tiny round pieces of popcorn shrimp floating in a glass of lime flavored water.  These were served with tortilla chips, which you'd think were meant to be used to scoop up the shrimp from the glass.  But, the shrimp are solid round balls, not a scoopable salsa.  We tried picking up the shrimp with the chips, but they'd just roll off and end up on the floor.  My date and I just laughed as we TRIED to eat this concoction.  When it finally made it into our mouths, it was gross anyway.  \n\nMy boyfriend ordered a sushi/sashimi combo platter.  I'm being generous by giving it a rating of mediocre.  Take out sushi from a grocery store is better.  \n\nNow, I admit, I made the mistake here - I ordered the fried fish platter.  I'm used to getting a variety at seafood restaurants.  At a place like Mitchell's Fish Market, you can get a dish with a piece of fish, a few scallops, a few shrimp, and a vegetable.  The Original Fish Market has no such dish.  The only dish I could get that had more than just one piece of fish with some plain steamed white rice and steamed spinach, was the fried fish platter.  So, I ordered that, with a side of green beans (vegetables were $5 - $7 extra).\n\nThe description said I would get a piece of tilapia, scallops, oysters, shrimp, and french fries.  I didn't realize this meant that the tilapia was fried, the scallops were fried, the oysters were fried, and the shrimp was fried, all on top of a giant bed of fried french fries.  It's just not what I pictured.  Like I said, it was my mistake for not reading carefully and not asking the waitress, but lets say for argument's sake that this is what I wanted.  \n\nIt was still disgusting.  The batter/flavor was exactly the same for everything.  The scallops tasted like the french fries.  The shrimp tasted like the french fries, the tilapia tasted like the french fries.  I didn't even try the oysters, but I'm pretty sure they would have tasted like french fries.  I ate barely a quarter of this dish, and I'm pretty sure I consumed an entire week's worth of saturated fat.  If you ate this entire plate, I think a heart attack would interrupt your dessert.\n\nThe green beans were good. \n\nOther people commented that you can't count on hotel restaurants being worthwhile.  I have to agree.  If everyone's just passing through, you don't have to worry about actually impressing anyone and getting them to come back.  And with business travelers, they're usually paying with their company's dime, so they don't bother to complain or expect much.\n\nI have learned my lesson.  I'm not coming back.  And I seriously question the sanity of people who gave this place more than two stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "z4cCguoHdU48pj6sXMIzqg"}

I enjoy a good French Dip and have tried many of them at all types of restaurants and this one was the worst I've ever eaten. In fact, I couldn't finish it.

I had been to Olive or Twist for drinks and really enjoyed it but had never been there for a meal.  I was going to a show at the Benedum with a friend and made reservations about a week and a half before the show.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for our 6:00 reservation expecting we may not be able to be seated yet.  The problem is that even though I called and made a reservation (including the person answering the phone taking my name and phone number and repeating the date and time) we were told there was no reservation for our name.  The hostess said something along the lines of \"are you sure you called here to make a reservation and not somewhere else\"  Yes, I'm pretty sure I called the right restaurant...  She kept looking at the room of empty tables, looking at the book and then looking at us.  After a few minutes of back and forth, she told us the lounge upstairs was open and we were welcome to grab a table up there.  So we trudged upstairs.  All that was available were small high top tables.  Being a Friday night, it was packed with the happy hour crowd and was pretty noisy.  Not really the environment we were looking for but we decided to make the most of it.\nWe started with the Buffalo Chicken Dip appetizer.  It is served in a martini glass with toasted/fried pita chips.  It was tasty and we were surprised at how much dip there actually was.  \nThe problems with food began with the pacing of the meal.  We had our appetizer for under five minutes when our entrees came out.  It may not have been a big deal if we were at a real table in the restaurant downstairs, but being at the high top bar tables, we had no room for our drinks, appetizer and meal.  We found ourselves stacking stuff and pulling things off the table in order to fit everything.  It was frustrating.  Not to mention that we would either have to let our entrees get cold as we finished the appetizer or let the appetizer get cold as we ate our entrees.  \nWith as much as we enjoyed the appetizer, we were looking forward to our meals. Unfortunately, they were very disappointing.  My friend ordered the french dip sandwich with a side of mashed potatoes.  Her potatoes were ice cold and sandwich luke warm.  When she mentioned it to the server, the server said \"so would you like me to take them back or are they ok\"  When would cold mashed potatoes ever be OK?  When her potatoes were brought back warmed, she was disappointed because they were called \"garlic mashed\" but she said they were pretty bland with not much garlic at all.\nI ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chicken.  It was described as \"grilled chicken seasoned with jerk spices, pepper jack cheese, garlic mayo and pineapple chutney on a Kaiser roll\"  No mention of a tomato.  When I got the sandwich, there were three tomatoes on it.   Thankfully I just dislike tomatoes and it wasn't an allergy issue.  There was also no pineapple chutney.  When I asked about it, the server told me they use a sauce and it must have been soaked into the roll.\nOverall, very disappointed.  I wanted to love Olive or Twist because I really enjoyed the time I had visited for a drink, but the dining experience was sorely lacking, especially for a dinner that was supposed to be a nice laid back start to our girl's night out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OxIeMVcop5oxBUWANi-1Rw"}

Someone at my table asked for no tomatoes and add onions and of course she got tomatoes and no onions.\n\nMaybe I ordered the wrong thing and maybe they were all just having a bad day...

It was quite large, cut in half, and brought on a piece of wax paper. As it turned out, I'm pretty sure the wax paper would have tasted better. It was really, really, not good. I did eat the first half, but the bread was so tasteless, I thought maybe it would be better if I ate the other half piece by piece. The coleslaw was OK, but the french fries were awful, and the little bit of actual meat had little taste. We had little to no contact with employees, but a cab driver told us about a young couple who dared to ask for a sandwich at another Primanti Bros without coleslaw, and were treated really rudely.

Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments, I order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. Since it was 11 in the morning, I chose not to order Primanti's #1 best seller, which the waitress told me was beer, but perhaps that would have made my experience better. As it was, I ordered the #2 best seller, the cheese steak. It was heinous. \n\nThink a grimy, mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced Italian bread served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries.\n\nFirst, the steak was disgusting: terrible flavor (smelled and tasted like hippie armpit, which I'm not necessarily opposed to as long as it's not involved in something I'm trying to eat) with a gross, processed meat texture. Secondly, the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich, with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally, the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches, but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury. \n\nMy dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries, and those were equally lack-luster. The \"bacon\" was simply bacon bits (oh, the humanity!), the chili was uninspired, and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)  \n\nI will never go back and I will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks Primanti Bros. produces decent food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NeUf9FyCCIN4MEseNyqkXQ"}

And it kills me that the place I gave it to had to be Primanti's. I'm an awful Pittsburgher.\n\nI don't give low ratings easily or often, so believe me: this place pushed all of my buttons to earn this awful review. In fact, the single star was only earned because the place is cleaner and more comfy than some of the other Primanti places I've been too. It kind of has an old diner feeling to it and I liked that. \n\nAlas, that's all I liked.\n\nSo, why such a low score? Well:\n\nThe service was terrible. After spending twenty minutes sitting without anyone coming to refill my water or ask for my actual order - note, the place was almost completely empty - I went to the register to ask for something to eat, which I'd started to think I had to do after watching a couple people do the same (in hindsight, I probably misinterpreted their actions, but my mistake does not excuse what happened next). My waiter looked at me and went, \"Don't you get the concept of a restaurant? Haven't you been to any restaurants, like, ever? Sit back down and I'll take your order.\" \n\nAnd not even in a joking manner that made me feel like I could smile about my mistake - this guy was being a condescending, rude, arrogant person. It was unbelievable. Utterly, totally unbelievable. If I hadn't met company there that night, I would have walked out right then.\n\nTo make matters worse, this was not a good night to order anything at Primanti's. The coleslaw was way too sweet and there was far too much of it, the fries were bland and had no texture at all, and there was barely any meat on my sandwich at all. The result? A big pile of carbs that really didn't taste great after the first few bites, rather than a delicious sandwich.\n\nBefore you all kill me, please note: I LIKED my meal at Mt. Lebanon's Primanti location. They also have a more diverse menu, which is always a bonus for me - I like having more options. I think in the future, I will stick to that location in this local chain, where even on a busy night I managed to get food in a decent amount of time.

Their sandwiches were always tasty, worth the wait and the trouble of finding parking etc. So, when my parents came to visit, and we made a trip out that-a-way, I knew that would be a lunch stop. We ended up coming into Pittsburgh on Sunday around 1pm. I knew it would be crowded and anticipated having a wait. We got a table after 15 to 20 minutes and quickly sat down before someone else did. It took the waitress about 10 minutes to come and clear the previous customers remnants, which was ok. \n\nWe ordered our beers and were told that she'd come back and take our order. She came back 20 minutes later, with the beers and took our order. After that, we sat around and waited for our sandwiches for 35 minutes. When we did finally get our food, it was ice cold. The fries in the sandwich were completely soggy and cold, and the meat was barely warm. Our table ran out of napkins, and we asked for some, but they never came, finally, the table next to ours handed us a few. Maybe it was because it was cold, but the sandwiches weren't that great. I had very little meat in mine, and more coleslaw that anything else. Also, the thickness of the bread seems to have increased since I last ate here because about 60% of my sandwich was bread. We were fairly disgruntled about the whole thing, but were still going to leave a tip for the waitress. \n\nThen, my dad went to the bar to pay. He stood there for 10 minutes, behind another customer. The server came up to them and said 'what the hell are you doing up here?', in those words!! My dad was so stunned be just stood there, the guy in line ahead of him told her that he was waiting to pay his bill, so she cashed him out and then turned around to do something else, when my dad said 'excuse me, i need to pay too', she replied to him ' Jeez, you guys are so demanding! Why the hell are you in such a hurry\". That is when their tip went straight out the door with us. \n\nWe were ok waiting for a table, we were even ok waiting for our food; it took them one hour from the time we sat down, to the time we got our food, and then the server had the audacity to behave in that manner.

It took the staff SO LONG to bring our lunch and when it finally came, my husband and I both got our sandwiches, but my daughter got nothing. Of course she was not happy about that at all, and trying to calm her down, we were giving her our food so that she had something, but she really wanted her pasta. My husband went to talk to the manager, and our server came over but STILL NO PASTA. 15-20 minutes later the pasta finally came out. And of course it was scalding hot. Not only was the pasta so hot that it was inedible (especially for a kid) there was a POOL of greasy butter and oil in the bottom of the bowl. I think my kid ate more of the grease than the actual pasta. It was DISGUSTING. This was such an absolutely horribly disappointment of a restaurant. Not to mention that the lobster roll was not even that great and definitely not worth $16. (Maybe it would have been better if it didn't sit on my plate for twenty minutes while I waited for my daughter's food). \n\nDon't waste your time here, especially if you have kids.

DO NOT GO HERE.\n\nMy family was visiting my sister in Pittsburgh and we had our eyes set on a specific restaurant, not Christos. A gentleman, I presume the owner of Christos, saw my family and I as we walked down the street. He flashed us his menu, pitching to us why his restaurant was the best and why his food was the best. I could barely tell if he was selling food or used cars. I kindly told him we were not interested. My family, however, was indecisive when it came to getting a restaurant. We ending up wanting to go eat at the restaurant next door to Christos so we backtracked. Again the owner flashed us his menu, sensing our touristy indecision. I again declined and pointed to the restaurant I was heading to. He then ignored me and pan-handled to my two sisters, mother and wife. They gave in to my dismay. As they said \"sure...\" I looked inside the restaurant of Christos at peak dinner hours.  No one was inside.  Absolutely no one. As my family walked in and I rolled my eyes, I thought, well let's give them a chance...my whole family seemed to feel bad for the guy and I like Greek food.\n\nAs we got in, it seemed nothing was going on. We had just came back from kayaking so we needed to wash our hands. They didn't seem to have a restroom but they took my sisters and mother through the kitchen and downstairs to find one. The silence was broken when they finally put music on and suddenly a couple of kitchen helpers came out and looked like they were warming some of the kitchen equipment up.  Were we their only customers tonight? I bet we were. Before I could settle in, he casually asked if I liked pita and hummus. Obviously I said yes. He was asking me so casually when I didn't even have a menu, I assumed it was complimentary when he said he would get me some, but as I waited I found his restaurant on Yelp with my phone and the first review gave them one star and mentioned how the owner didn't tell him the pita was extra.  Great. \n\nThe rest of my family later came back from the restroom (akin to going to a restroom at a grocery store where you're around stock items...except you need to go through their kitchen). They started with salad. The waiter asked if I wanted anchovies or something else on my salad. I was going to say \"sure\" but my wife stopped me and said it could be extra. The waiter, looking like he got caught, verified he was offering all extras to me even though earlier the owner said salads came with dinner. I had to say,\"I just want the standard salad, nothing extra.\" I couldn't let my guard down.\n\nWe ordered some food, priced about what you'd expect.  The pita and hummus I ordered earlier was just barely average so I don't know why they thought it was worth $4. My sister ordered \"leg of lamb\" so I expected to see a leg of a lamb. Instead when her plate came out, it looked like sad slices of ham. Really. We all got vegetables but they were soggy and unappetizing. I saw them earlier in the kitchen sitting in a big pot when I had used the restroom. Nothing here is fresh. My lamb was on the chewy side. My sister's \"leg of lamb\" was left uneaten and she asked if I wanted some. I \"tried\" to eat it but it was too chewy. They then asked for dessert. I wanted to say no out of my discontent but again my family members all said yes, even when they were telling me the food was not great.  I don't have their sense of pity. The desert and salad were the best things of the night, which was kind of sad. \n\nWhen we got the receipt and my wife insisted we check it.  Surprise. They overcharged us $7 from two mysterious items. Their receipt doesn't even list what you ordered. I went up the the cashier to ask them what the two items were. He tried to explain one but he really couldn't. He scratched out the $3 item. I then questioned the $4 charge. Again he tried to explain it but he really couldn't. Again he agreed with me and scratched out the $4.  On top of all this we still gave them a normal tip out of pity. I could tell the waiters were just following orders. I could tell the owner had trained them what to say and how to make extra money.\n\nYou've been warned. There's a reason why this place is doing so poorly.  There's a reason why the whole hour between 7:30pm and 8:30pm we were the only ones in the restaurant. There's a reason why the owner is begging customer to come in. They're cutting corners on customer service and food quality in exchange for salesman tactics, overcharging and tricking you to buy things you don't even know is extra. DO NOT GO HERE.\n\nOwners like this will say,\"But I have to or else I won't make it.\" You know what? Restaurants like yours shouldn't make it. Not to be harsh but it was a poor experience. Change your food, your sales tactics and your fake receipt items strategy. Maybe a long time ago when they started they were real but now they are doing every dirty trick in the book to nickel and dime you.  \n\nWARNING.

As I alway say it doesn't take a rocket scientist to boil noodles and open a jar of pasta sauce and grate some cheese. For years this place has been touted as a diamon in the ruff in an area of the strip that has since built up greatly over the last 20 years. I had gone in the past but most recently decided to visit again because of their 'no coupon lunch special' advertised in the Sunday paper and also in the Red Plum coupon section. It was around $5 for Spaghetti Marinara a salad and what they call fresh baked bread. Let me say the spaghetti came out in a bowl with alot of tomato chunks and what looked like some raw oregano shaken on top. The noodles (from a box, definately not fresh pasta) were room temperature along with a quite a bit of water that settled to the bottom of the bowl from the sauce seperating. I would honestly rather have had Ragu Robusto from a jar instead of this particular sauce. It tasted like stomach acid, was sour and had not texture to it. The oregano flavor was overbearing and quite off putting. The salad was as described in the review below mine, watery iceberg with brown edges and some dressing spooned on top. We ended up eating alot of bread since nothing else was appetizing. The first one came out warm and the second one was cold and a bit hard. I am going to take a wild guess and say that the bread loaves are made off site and come in a plastic bag inside a giant box such as brown and serve rolls. You can tell they are placed in some type of convection oven to be heated slightly before they serve it to you. It's pretty much a crap shoot if you get a warm one or not. With the special price, tax & tip and depending on if you buy a beverage or not you end up paying about $7 to $9 per person anyway. Not sure if this is your idea of a cheap lunch but at home I can make this meal from about $2 per person and it is always way better. Do yourself a favor and go out and buy some fresh pasta at one of the stores in the Strip, touch up one of your favorite jar sauces with a little Italian sausage, buy a bag of butter lettuce and some salad dressing from Aldi and a fresh loaf of Mancinis bread at your local supermarket and have a feast, save your money by not frequenting places like this.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9mwShpTgZofOujt4JfyGmw"}

The pinot grigio was vile, but, hey, thanks for charging us for the more expensive version: lord knows how disgusting the cheaper version would have been.   Finally, after 20 minutes we were seated.  Not a table in the bar area had been cleaned in that period.\n\nAnd the restaurant is empty!  Maybe 20% full!  They made us wait simply because they can't staff correctly.  Acres of empty tables.  So we sit, look at the menu, check out the surrounding (few) tables and made the only good decision we made this night:  we left and found another place in the area.  A place that actually worked to seat us and made us feel welcome.\n\nThe most amazing thing:  between the greeter, the bartender, and the seater, there was not a single smile.  Not a single sign that they actually are happy that we chose their establishment.  And not a sign that that they gave a damn whether we ever wanted to come back.  No wonder it is 80% empty but still makes people wait.\n\nThe other reviews compare this to Olive Garden and the like.  As my review makes clear, I can't compare the food.  And I am certainly not a fan of the Olive Garden.  But the few times I have gone into one, I was made to feel welcome.  Certainly not here.  \n\nThe place is living off memories:  I don't think it is creating any new (positive) ones.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9mwShpTgZofOujt4JfyGmw"}

It was for a late lunch (about 2:00 p.m. when we arrived).  We were greeted by the hostess who took us to our table (which was in the trolley car).  It's a visually interesting place to dine.  However, our chairs were rickety and appeared ready to collapse. \n\nThe restaurant was mostly empty (which was not a surprise as we got there after the prime lunch hour but before dinner).  And yet although there wasn't a lot of other customers there all vying for the attention of the servers, it took an unusually long time for our waitress to arrive at our table.  (A pattern which continued throughout the duration of our stay).   \n\nOn the back of the menu, there is a section for lunch entrees.  I ordered the \"Amazing 15 Layer Lasagne\".   The three other people in my party all ordered the spaghetti with meatballs.   The food was...okay.  Nothing to write home about.  I've been eating Italian food for almost five decades.  And this is average - at best.  I'd say on par or slightly below Olive Garden.  It wasn't the worst food, but certainly not the best.  And again, I cannot overemphasize how below par the service was.   \n\nBut the thing which really upset me was when we got our check.  They charged us dinner prices for each of our meals.   Again, there is ONE menu, and the pack of the menu has the lunch section.  It reads (until 3:00 p.m.).   What I failed to see (because it's in fine print) is the part where they only offer lunch prices Monday through Friday.   Really?  REALLY?   Are you kidding me?   That's B.S., no matter how you view it.  At no time did either the hostess or the waitress bother to explain to us up front that the lunch pricing wasn't in effect.   \n\nI HATE being ripped off.  And any restaurant which does that kind of crap is RIPPING PEOPLE OFF.   So congratulations, Spaghetti Warehouse.  You got the better of me.  And I will never, ever go there again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9mwShpTgZofOujt4JfyGmw"}

We used to come here for college events and schedule ahead of time for a large group - then again, this was always on weeknights... when they were slow... thank goodness. I always loved the food here (then again, these dishes aren't anything scientific - they are basic - comfort food), and I thought the gigantic restaurant could handle large groups well... until I brought 10 people here for a birthday dinner on a Saturday. \n\nFirst of all, we had reservations but still stood awkwardly in the waiting area for a while to be seated. Not terrible. Then we were seated - the server was flustered and irritated before we had a chance to speak. Long story short, we waited 1.5 hours for our food (pasta... yes - the stuff you make at home for an entire family in 10 minutes), the waitress spent all her time coming to her table bashing the kitchen staff to us (not exactly professional), and the manager was no where to be seen. C'mon, manager! It's your job to sail this ship - get it together. From my line of vision, I could see about 7 servers running around like chickens with their heads cut off doing nothing but throwing the kitchen staff under the bus. Dear manager: if you have this many employees standing around doing nothing but complaining, put a few of them to work in the kitchen. \n\nThe place is cute and I really want to like it again, but I probably won't return until the management learns how to... manage. True, this isn't Capital Grill, nor was I expecting 5-star service. In all honesty, I'm from the middle-of-nowhere Ohio. I didn't even know what fine dining was until college. It's just that I've had better service at Arby's on a Friday at 12 noon when they have a line 20 people deep and cars wrapped around the building 3 times in the drive-thru. \n\nSaving grace: the sangria was good... thankfully, because that's the only thing we consumed for 90 minutes while waiting on our luke-warm dinners to arrive.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9mwShpTgZofOujt4JfyGmw"}

While the rolls are large, the prices were quite steep, not what i was expecting for someone based in a market that sells seafood.", "type": "review", "business_id": "L5387MoRyx9orlRyYfCSPA"}

The food that was delivered to us was simply inedible. Point blank. \n\nMy husband and I ordered a bunch of sushi for dinner with the plan of having tasty leftovers for lunch the next day, so we splurged a little, spent like $60 on various rolls. The presentation was pretty pathetic - wilting nori, leading us to believe these rolls were pre-made; hot pink ginger, meaning it's the MSG-soaked kind; glue-like rice, where you can't see the individual grains - but what really horrible was the smell. When we took the lid off the tray, the stench of rotten fish knocked both if us back. I honestly gagged.\n\nIt was so awful, we just stared at each other, amazed that we just spent our money on a pile of stinking rot. Determined to not waste everything, I picked up a piece of spider roll to sniff/inspect/try. IT HAD A HUGE HAIR IN IT, all wound around the crab. Totally disgusting. My husband attempted to try the inari - just tofu and rice, right? It tasted like rotten fish, as it had absorbed all the smells from the other fish rolls. \n\nWe had also ordered a vegetable and tofu soup, and a green salad with ginger dressing. Can't even believe this, but the salad leaves were brown and slimy on the ends! They actually screwed up a green salad. The soup tasted like the inside of an aluminum pot, all metallic and burnt-flavored. Horrible, horrible, horrible. We literally dumped everything down the garbage disposal. Total waste.\n\nWe tried to call and complain, but by the time our order was delivered, the place was closed. We will be calling again today to get our money back. Maybe they will earn themselves another star if they do the right thing and refund our money.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dHDi4wCcjsOR6vcZ8oOIoA"}

Assuming that the rolls were made long before I got them, I just threw out the tuna roll, which was warmer than room temp anyway. Vegetable roll was good, but not exceptional. Fried rice was...just not what I expected, not exceptional either. In short, I paid almost $40 for a cucumber roll and two bites of rice. \n\nMaybe this is better when you dine in.

My party of 4 arrived at 5ish expecting a packed restaurant but the place was EMPTY.  We asked for a table and were told due to the amount of reservations it was going to be an hour.  I get that--but the place was EMPTY.  The host was NOT gracious about this, instead he seemed frazzled and bothered by our being there.\n\nWe sat at the super cool looking bar and ordered drinks and asked if we could order appetizers to the bar.  The bartender, who was a complete dick, said, \"I have a full house tonight, I'm not going to take food orders at the bar.\"  \n\nI'd like to mention this guy is apparently the bar tender at the Papa J's in Carnegie--not the regular bartender who is awesome.\n\nThe place is EMPTY.  We order drinks.  And we wait, and we wait, and we wait.  All the while we can see empty tables and I kept thinking...you know...if you had just sat us we would have been out of here by now!  So I asked the bartender who was helping the host...  \"Why can't you just seat us since the place is empty, its been an HOUR and we just want to know when you think we might get seated.\"  We would have left but honestly we were invested with our time at this point.  The bartender said, \"Well, for all the people who could take the time to make a reservation, we hold a table for them.\"  Well...yikes.  If this is how you act no wonder your restaurant has been dead every single other time we have been there.\n\nWhen we finally were sat, we were seated in a tiny table wedged in a room with a huge party that was three sets of parents and like, their 36 screaming children.  It was such a nightmare.\n\nTurns out they had the regular bartender waiting tables that night and he felt so bad about our wait and where we got seated he took one of the entrees off the bill.  So that was cool, but not enough to make up for his moron coworker.\n\nStrike 2 - If you go there for lunch and you order a hamburger, expect the waitress to give you attitude if you ask for cheese.  \"Yeah, if you didn't know this was an italian restaurant and we only have mozzerella.\"  Really?  I didn't know hamburgers were traditional Italian fare.  I wouldn't have been that upset but my hamburger--which was burnt, flavorless, and tasted like freezer burn along with my diet coke came to $14.00.  For a burger.  and a coke.  The prices here can be ridiculous.\n\nStrike 3-  Empty restaurant.  I mean, EMPTY.  My friend and i are there and we had bread wiith our meals.  Our thing of olive oil was empty, and there was a full thing of olive oil on the table next to ours.  NO ONE ELSE in the same dining room.  I took the olive oil off the table next to ours.  Our waitress came over and was like, \"Ma'am, this is not a free for all, you can't just take things from the tables if you need something you have to ask.\"  WTF!  There was no one there and it was just olive oil... and also had she been attentive, I wouldn't have needed to take the olive oil.  She would have brought us a full one.\n\nSo, I've tried this place 5 times and that was enough.  I dont know how it remains open but I suspect it will close soon.  Not worth the attitude of the staff.  They dont seem to appreciate the few customers they do have which is a shame, bc when I like a restaurant I recommend it and I bring my friends there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SzHTdZR3yY1WBYUxkVxmUQ"}

I've been there for brunch in the past and had good meals, so I thought it'd be a nice place to take my Italian hubby. We both selected the prix fix menu with wine pairings. ($35 + $22). \n\nIt was apparent when we sat down that they were understaffed. The hostess began taking our drink order because our waitress was busy. When the waitress finally got to our table, we told her that we wanted to do the wine pairing and she offered us a few tasting options. They had a decent wine selection, and both her recommendations were delicious.\n\nWe both started our meals with caesar salads. The salads came out and the plates were a little sloppy in appearance. They were over-dressed and way too big for a starter salad, and the croutons were soggy as if they had been sitting in the dressing for a while. At this point, we hadn't seen our waitress in a long time; maybe 15 minutes had gone by and we were nearly done with our salads before the wines came.\n\nFor the main course, I selected the gnocchi and grilled sausage. The sausage was made in-house and was very flavorful. The gnocchi, however, was so burnt it was like eating dehydrated, crunchy noodles with a dense chewy inside. Very unappetizing and I was unable to continue eating.\n\nMy husband had the pasta trio, which is a table-side serving of three different pastas. The first was a spiral noodle in red tomato sauce, which was good. The pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce wasn't too sweet. The second pasta was gnocchi in a sage cream sauce, also good. The third pasta was supposed to be linguine in a mushroom sauce, but the noodles were extremely under-cooked, some of them still clumped together at one end, and there wasn't any sauce in the pan. Even the server commented on the lack of a sauce. It was inedible..\n\nAgain, our waitress was gone for a long time and one of the nearby servers noticed that we weren't eating our meals and we were actively searching for our waitress. He came over to our table and we explained the situation. He was really nice and immediately went to find the manager to get it fixed. In the meantime, our waitress did stop by and we explained again to her. She also went to find the manager. The manager came over to our table almost immediately. She was very kind and apologetic, indicating they were having a very bad day in the kitchen. She offered us new plates of food, but at this point we weren't very hungry and still hadn't eaten dessert. The manager offered to pay for our meals and dessert. I had a Nutella tart and my husband had tiramisu, both yummy, but too large to finish.\n\nBefore leaving, our waitress told us we should come back, especially after they had plans to remodel in the near future. Not sure that we will after this experience...", "type": "review", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg"}

It was not Like The lidia's program on Wqed. I think Lidia &Grandma would be appalled! I had a salad with a red wine vinegar&EVOO dressing on request. Someone in kitchen in charge of salads don't know how to make a proper easy dressing! I am a retired Sous Chef 10 yrs retired at a resort hotel in Miami beach. So I was appalled by a lousy not fresh dirty salad! Yes dirty! The endive had the bottom cores on them and wasn't washed properly. The veggies tomatoes were gross and the dressing was mixed oil vinegar only no herbs! I pushed it away ugh! Then I had the gnocchi my Mom used to make from scratch ! This wasn't that! This was the frozen gnocchi I in supermarkets they were all the same size and the taste was that you find in a store not fresh made! Don't be fooled! It came w duck ragu that was ice cold! They must of forgot to heat it up. Desert time! Well I was still very hungry order coffee and Tiramisu was a old soggy mess! Last piece in fridge seemed like. I hate Olive garden but Lidia's made that good! Next time want Italian& nice prices go to Alexander's in Bloomfield all their pastas made to order in kitchen it says on their menu may take  10 extra minutes to prepare since they make them to order! Try their Calamari over Angel hair yum! Until Lidia's comes here and inspects & teaches that staff how to cook her recipes they are not what she makes on tv! I made her recipes and they were really great this was simply Gross& high priced too!& I went by Access so didn't have to pay $7.00 valet parking fee!", "type": "review", "business_id": "XmdTkxKyJd7TuDLoiic1kg"}

First off, it is desperately in need of some updates.  There are old crappy projector screens and a few big rear projection TVs, but not an HDTV in sight.  There are TVs aplenty, but they just feel dinghy and outdated and the reception on every TV is snowy.\n\nThe biggest issue, however, is that apparently they're only able to show 6 games at any 1 time throughout the huge bar area.  There are several main bar islands, booths, and pub tables all over with individual TV screens at each booth.  Sounds good, but what good are all these seats if you can only show 6 games?  That is absurd when you consider how huge Sports Rock is, especially during college football.  I went to watch a game that was on regular old ESPN, and they weren't showing the game.  You mean I could go to my hotel to watch the game but am unable to watch it at a \"sports bar\"??  Give me a break.\n\nFood is also generally terrible.  Nachos are no better than what you can get at 7-11 and sandwiches have no flavor.  And service is piss poor and understaffed.  I'm not sure if they recently changed ownership or what, but something was very very off here and they were obviously unprepared for the start of the football season.\n\nI feel bad because the people were very nice and apologetic, but that does not take away from the fact that even if they were showing my game, I think I'd still rather watch it in my hotel room.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HDTv_rnmSL8AQ04_zTWARA"}

They just need to have four things\n1. ESPN\n2. Nachos pilled high with all kinds of stuff\n3. beer specials\n4. big screen TVs.\n\nWell Sports Rock failed on all accounts.  I was encouraged when we walked in and saw individual TVs on each table.  Of course we picked the one that didn't work!  Then we realized while there were many out of market games, the Virginia Tech one was nowhere to be seen. So we politely ask for ESPN.  Not ESPN U or 360 or anything fancy.  Plain old regular ESPN.  Then we get some story about how they only have six recievers.  Thats fine.  But why am i watching the Maine/Iowa game.  SERIOUSLY.  I was also annoyed that when the cute girl walked up to the bar, he had the Georgia game on within minutes. \n\nThe nachos were absolutely disgusting and my wrap just leaked oil and disgustingness.   The fries were even terrible, but i found if you dipped them in the gross nacho cheese, they weren' that bad.   \n\nPlus, beer was 4.75!  Multiply that by a 3 hour game and you're paying a lot.  Service was awful and i think i would get better reception on a tv with rabbit ears.  Overall this place sucked, although i will give them credit as we were finally getting up to leave and go to an Irish Bar that was able to show ESPN, i noticed the hokie game all the way back in the corner.  Took them long enough.\n\nIf you're ever in Pittsburgh in need of watching ESPN heres my idea.  Grab a permanti brothers sandwich and a six pack of beer and watch it in your hotel room rather than waste your money to sit and watch Maine vs Iowa on a crappy little tv with no reception.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HDTv_rnmSL8AQ04_zTWARA"}

This proved to have been a massive error in judgement on all our parts.\n\nThe first thing I ordered was a bowl of lemongrass soup.  The listing of ingredients made it seem like it should be tom yum soup, which is one of my favorite soups.  What I received was a bowl of dishwater-colored broth containing tomatoes, so that it tasted like watered-down minestrone, with some chicken submerged in shame at the bottom of the bowl.  A single lonely wilted leaf of cilantro wallowed on top.  No lemongrass was in evidence, but there were plenty of mushrooms.  I stopped eating this when I unearthed an unsightly artifact which turned out to be the bottom of a mushroom stem, with dirt still clinging to it.\n\nMy companions both got chicken and stir-fried vegetables in what turned out to be Singapore curry sauce.  This was passable, but not exciting -- again, although it claimed to be lemongrassy, there was no lemongrass flavor to be had, and the chicken was a bit rubbery and overdone.\n\nI got one of the fish entrees.  On the menu, the description made out like it was covered in a spicy sauce.  It turned out to be more like a not-at-all-spicy soup with bits of orange roughy floating in it.  Again, the broth was lacking in overall flavor, as if they were trying to save on costs by not adding enough spices.  The fish itself was at least not overcooked or dirty, but it was a poor aesthetic decision to bread and fry the piece of fish, then put the breaded coating into soup.  Gross.\n\nTo top it off, the service wasn't that great, and we were actually charged for the dirt-filled soup.  We will not be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Lm_mR5xDF91OeZw97ch41g"}

By the time I found the small amt. of lettuce at the bottom of the bowl, it was warm and wilted. The turkey tasted really bad, like it had been overheated in a microwave.

The first time I dined here, I was looking forward to it, because everyone whom I've ever heard talk about this place raved about it, yet I left wondering if everyone who has raved about it just has really bad taste in restaurants and their definition of \"good\" food.\n\nSo, on my second visit I inwardly cringed as my 2 companions raved about the place and teased the waitress about the list of specials which is absolutely ridiculous however it does seem as though the restaurant has pared down their enormous menu and specials menu from the only other time that I was there (I remember it taking our waitress at least 5 minutes to ramble off the specials on the previous visit while on this particular visit it seemed to take half the time.  \n\nI ordered the linguine with shrimp scampi which I asked to add spinach but was told that it already had spinach (the menu is so large that it would be impossible for them to list the ingredients in each dish) - so while someone may think, \"oh, it's great that they have a large menu,\" the truth of the matter is that they don't seem to be able to therefore do anything well - it's all rather extremely mediocre at best to nearly inedible.  My companions enjoyed their meals however, and they ordered the linguine with salmon and the smoked hot dog special covered in some sort of  BBQ type of sauce.  My pasta was bland - I never add salt when I go out to eat and I had to add salt but even adding salt and some pepper really did nothing to give the dish flavor.  I left the restaurant dissatisfied and hungry for a good plate of pasta, which I rarely eat by the way, and it actually had me thinking about how much better the Olive Garden's pasta is compared to Cafe Sam.  I'm just completely baffled about the popularity of this restaurant though as some others who have given the restaurant the fair 1-3 star reviews have already mentioned, this is a haven for senior citizens and from the other Yelp reviews for out of town guests who maybe don't know what good food really is.  With all of the other options available nearby in Shadyside and in Bloomfield this is the last place that I would go next to the other Baum Blvd. debacle, Ritter's Diner.  I don't know why or how folks flock to either restaurant nor how they rave about either establishment other than to say that both places must hold some nostalgic value that makes people overlook the bad food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XzaJf6WzpU7RsXTXzx72Xg"}

While the people running the shop were lovely, it was not worth the $17 or so we paid.\n\nI had small cheese steak sub - asking only for mayo and lettuce. you would think that might be a nice time to let me know that they use some sort of house garlic-herb mayo instead of actual mayo. but no. So after a good bit of waiting my sub comes out with this weird speckly dressing on top of the lettuce... yes, this is that mayo - which is disgusting. I thought it was ranch and that is when he lady, with a smile, explained it was their house mayo... no, they don't use regular mayo here. \n\nso, let me tell you about this mayo:\n\n1. it is heavily flavored with garlic powder - which tastes seriously like chemicals on a good day and just should not be considered food in any way shape or form. Mixed in with this were some dried herbs - maybe an italian mix? who knows. all I could taste was the overwhelming chemical, fake garlic flavor. Hey, I love garlic and cook with it daily - mind you I actually use the real stuff. \n\n2. it is really thin... I mean thin like salad dressing, runny, thin. Um, isn't mayo supposed to be thick and spreadable? even the stuff you see at subway is thicker. this stuff tasted like really cheap, bad, ranch dressing.\n\nSo, after giving it a good effort to try to eat this \"sub\" - I gave up and picked off the bread on the top of the sub - the bread was pretty stellar though. still hungry I decided to try to scrap off the mayo/lettuce disaster and go for the meat and cheese. um... salt? the meat, which suspiciously looked like those thin sheets of steak-um had zero flavor. one bite and I rejected it. While we are talking about the meat - why use this garbage? I am paying almost 6 bucks for this sub. I want to see yummy chopped up steak bits like you see at even a mall sub shop. not this grey, disgusting 1980s looking flavorless \"meat\".  At least the bottom of the sub roll was salvageable... I ate the bread. \n\nOn to the pizza. My husband had two slices of pepperoni and my daughter had a slice of plain cheese. \n\nOk, pizza. well, this too was a massive disappointment. since I was still hungry after dumping the majority of my sub I tried both of their pizza slices. it reminded me of a nice store-bought frozen pizza. yes, bland. bad sauce with flavorless cheese. \n\nMy husband is a freak for pepperoni pizza and of the two slices he almost finished one of them. yes, more for the garbage. My daughter? she is three.. she isn't really a foodie (yet) but she got thru some of her cheese pizza... she actually spit some of it out but to be fair - she is three. I tried her pizza and honestly, all I could manage to somewhat enjoy was the crust which was nothing to rave about but it was tolerable. \n\nTo provide a baseline - we typically order from Rialto's and while they are not terrible they decent enough for a sub shop - pizza place.  this place... ugh. never. again. ever. We ended up throwing out about 80% of what we paid for. This place insults their customers with sub-par, dated, poor quality food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PTS4MxQel-xzj5qWxVn3LQ"}

It looked a mess. The spring rolls were cut up brutally and then everything was tossed in. Usually when you order this at other place, it doesn't come \"pre-mixed.\" Honestly, it looked like someone had already starting eating this. I thought to myself... \"Okay they have a different presentation style.\" \n\nBut as I ate, I was even more disappointed. They hardly put any fresh vegetables in it, and the vermicelli is overcooked. The spring rolls were completely soggy. \n\nI don't think their menu is limited though, it seemed fairly typical. I don't know, maybe their Pho is better, but I'm already too disappointed to come back.\n\nAfter reading other people's reviews and trying other Vietnamese places around the city and then having Vietnamese food in Toronto(at an average place), I'm throughly convinced that people in this city have no idea what Vietnamese food is supposed to taste like.\n\nOh and one last thing... do you actually believe that their food is vegetarian?

All I care about was the authenticity of the food & cost for what it's worth.\n\nI started my meal with an appetizer of Goi Cuon with shrimp.  I was highly disappointing when disecting what was in it.  There was 1 shrimp cut in half lengthwise, mainly bun (rice noodle) for fillers along with a few strands of beansprouts & lettuce to make it look presentable.  I quickly devoured the tiny appetizer in 2 bites.  My main entree was Pho Ha Noi.  It took forever for the food to arrive, it was a big bowl.  Until I stirred it around to find out it was mainly broth and green onions.  The broth was flavorless, actually it didn't have any flavor; so I had to add hoisin sause to give it a little of whatever to go along with the sliced pork.  I was confused about the noodle itself, Pho is usually served with flat vermicelli noodle; but this Pho Ha Noi was served with round vermicelli noodles usually for Bun Bo entree.  I asked the old man with the amputated arm, why it was served with bun (round rice noodle) instead of pho (flat rice noodle) noodles, he laughed and insisted it was pho (flat rice noodle).  Ok I may be young but I wasnt born yesterday, I think I know my pho noodle and sorry it wasn't.  \n\nNext visit to the 'burgh, I think I'll try Pho Minh & see how their PHO compares to Tram's Kitchen.

I politely ask if we could pay separately (there were four of us). He grunts something inaudible with a sourpuss look on his face and I ask him to repeat himself.

I can not stand when waitresses/waiters see that we're younger (I'm 25, my friends are in their early 30s) and assume that they can drop all professionalism and talk to us like we're their friends. I sympathize with you being slammed but I don't want to hear you complaining nor do I want to hear about you getting wasted. We should have requested another waitress at that moment.\n\nTwo other tables who were seated 10-15 minutes after us got their food about 20 minutes before us. Two other waitresses were working the room and seemed fast and competent. We were the only table with Misty, who was working both the bar area and us. She never checked on us, took forever to get our food to us (which I'm assuming was sitting back in the kitchen for quite some time) and after we finished, we sat there for 20 minutes before we finally flagged down the hostess for our check.

I lived about an hour and a half outside of the city. Coming here was usually pretty exciting. (Here as in the city, not Silky's.) I had a friend who lived here in the East End and on the street I reside on now. \n\nSeveral times we found ourselves at Silky's Pub. I love the corner building, the way it looks out onto Liberty Ave. It looks so welcoming. Especially in the summer. Outdoor seating, always pretty well packed with people.\n\nI'll come right out and say that the crowd that frequents Silky's isn't my usual crowd, but unlike some bars I'd never had an issue with someone wanting to start a fight with us because we look like a bunch of dirty malcontents. This place is just not our usual dive bar.\n\nThursday night my boyfriend texted me that he was there with a mutual friend. Living less than a city block from there I headed over. I needed a beer and some hockey/world series action to distract me after the Halloween parade. It was as busy as usual. A few seats remaining and I managed to snag one right at the bar, front and center.\n\nI hate to say this because I don't remember this happening years ago when I went there. I was not even acknowledged. I get flagging down a bartender in a crazy busy bar in the South Side on a Friday night. I don't like it but I get it. This was a moderately steady Thursday night. I wasn't standing behind the people's sitting at the bar. I was the person sitting at the bar. There were two male bartenders both bartenders asked the guy next to me multiple times if he wanted anything else to drink. \n\nBy \"multiple times\" I mean 6 or 8 times. The person sitting directly beside me. They wouldn't look at me. I tried to make eye contact with either of them and it was as if I wasn't even there. Eventually the boyfriend's beer emptied as well. This is about 20 minutes after I arrived. I've had people walk in and stand behind us and the bar tender or waitress was on them immediately. After another 5 minutes of the boyfriend's beer being perched precariously on the edge of the bar and the bartenders standing there chatting he had to ask the bartender for a refill and if I could have a drink.\n\nThe bartender looks up at him, grabs his pint glass angrily from the bar and says, \"Oh, you wanted another?\" \n\nReally? I was so angry at that point that it took everything I had not to ask the guy what his issue was.  I later saw him drop a pint glass and stumble into something so many he was drunk.\n\nThe food that other people ordered smelled and looked great. Even the seafoody bits which I normally hate smelling. The tv's are plentiful and newer. I just don't know if I'll ever get to go back and try the food as I hate being slighted by a business owner and treated as if my business isn't appreciated.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3zgswf_NfBJpeAoWeTkgMA"}

I cook tons of Italian food for myself, family, and friends, and I only use the highest quality ingredients and go about preparing my meals in traditional southern Italian ways.

The manager SCREAMED AT ME at the top of his lungs in an epic meltdown that lasted 10 minutes! \n\nOn Sat., April 12, 2014, I attended the 50th birthday party for my dear friend, David Flynn. I organized the party, but relied on Dave and his sister to provide me with the final head count. I made the reservation for 25 people.\n\nThe manager and I played phone tag for the two days before the event. I called back and left messages TWICE to confirm, but apparently he never got my messages. (This was part of his rant, his indignation at unreturned phone calls that actually HAD been returned!)\n\nThe dinner started at 7 PM. Most of our group arrived on time, but some of our group (including me) arrived between 8 PM-9 PM. I was working on a homemade birthday present for Dave, which took longer than expected. I called Dave, his sister and my friends (Reesa & Joel) to tell them I was running late. In hindsight, I should have also called the restaurant to let them know, and for that I am truly sorry. That still doesn't justify the manager SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!\n\nAfter enjoying a delicious dinner, drinks and birthday cake, none of us had a clue that anything was wrong. If the decision to return to a restaurant were based SOLELY on the food and wait staff, I would definitely return to Alexander's. But sadly, when the manager has a nuclear meltdown and throws a 10-MINUTE SCREAMING TEMPER TANTRUM, it tends to sour one on returning to a restaurant.\n\nTowards the end of our dinner, some of us started to smell cigarette smoke, which we later realized was coming from the patio out front. (It was a warm night, and they had the front sliding-glass doors open.) In the midst of the smoke discussion, the manager approached our table and began an EPIC RANT, SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!!!\n\nHe was angry that everyone in our group hadn't arrived at exactly 7 PM. The restaurant's kitchen is open till 10 PM on Sat. night, so I don't understand why this was a big deal. We ended up with 20 people total and 5 no-shows. I am always disappointed by no-shows, but I explained this possibility to the manager when I made the reservation. I STILL BROUGHT HIM 20 PAYING CUSTOMERS! \n\nBTW...the dining room was practically EMPTY, which is not what I would expect on a Saturday night in Pittsburgh. Maybe I'm not the first customer to be on the receiving end of the manager's meltdown.\n\nThe manager SCREAMED that he had called me twice, and I hadn't called him back! He ranted about this about a dozen times. I told him I HAD called him back - TWICE. It's not my fault if he didn't get my messages. \n\nHe SCREAMED that he had put an extra waitress and cook on staff because he expected 25 people. He SCREAMED that I had cost the restaurant $100! How much money do you think 20 people spent on appetizers, dinner and drinks? I find it hard to believe that they didn't make any money, or at least break even. \n\nI am sorry that there were 5 no-shows in our group, but I always thought Saturday night was the busiest night of the week for most restaurants. I didn't realize the restaurant would look like a deserted, old western ghost town with hardly any customers. On a Saturday night, I assumed they would have a full staff on duty with or without my reservation. I was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm not perfect.\n\nThe manager also YELLED at me and my friends for \"LOOKING COMFORTABLE\" in his restaurant!!! Since when is looking comfortable an OFFENSE??? I thought restaurants wanted you to feel comfortable, but apparently not at Alexander's.\n\nHe also SCREAMED that one of the waitresses only got a $1.00 tip! I found that hard to believe, but just in case he wasn't making it up, I tipped my waitress $35 on my $26 dinner check! I am a former waitress, and I would feel HORRIBLE if any waitress every got ripped off on my watch! Even if his story wasn't true, I figured she deserved an extra big tip just for having to WORK in such a horrible place where the manager YELLS at paying customers!!! If he treats the customers this way, I can only imagine how he treats the employees. \n\nTHE MANAGER'S RUDE BEHAVIOR HAS COST HIM MY BUSINESS AND MY FRIENDS' BUSINESS FOREVER!!! During his rant, he actually SCREAMED that he never wanted to see me in his restaurant ever again! I'm happy to grant him that wish. And so are my friends. \n\nThis is an example of the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever witnessed in my entire life!!! I thought the manager was going to have a heart attack or a stroke the way he was SCREAMING FOR 10 MINUTES!\n\nSCREAMING at paying customers is completely unacceptable behavior, and I will NEVER eat at Alexander's ever again. It's really a shame because I loved their salmon with pesto sauce. But great food can't make up for a manager who throws a TEMPER TANTRUM and SCREAMS AT YOU. Also, you can smell smoke in the dining room, which sucks. My friends and I are BOYCOTTING ALEXANDER'S FOR LIFE!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "5MChfa-jZfMo3vBpolkSbw"}

I went there with my girlfriend and my parents on a Saturday night, and from start to finish the experience that Alexander's gave us was simply awful. First, when we arrived around 6 pm, the restaurant was half-empty (bad sign #1). The hostess seated us at a table in the center of the very cramped and very small dining room (bad sign #2). Then, our waitress did not even come over to take drink orders for another 10 minutes (bad sign #3).\n\nOnce the waitress finally arrived and took our orders, the food itself offered no relief. My girlfriend and I ordered the Caesar salad - the salads were drowning in Caesar dressing, the croutons were badly burnt and inedible, and there were too many croutons to begin with. This restaurant couldn't even get a simple salad right, but I hoped against hope that the entrees would be an improvement.\n\nUnfortunately, the entrees were no better. My girlfriend ordered Chicken Alfredo. Not only was the dish absurdly light on chicken (3 small pieces total? Come on!), the alfredo sauce was thick and gummy to the point of tasting like glue. My mom ordered the Mushroom ravioli, which was completely bland. I ordered the Veal Diablo with Shrimp; the plate came with 3 pieces of veal sliced extremely thin, 3 nice sized shrimp, and... that was it. No pasta, no garlic bread, nothing but an ocean of very mediocre marinara sauce. I finished my entire plate, the remaining half of my mom's plate after she was finished eating, and as much as I could stomach of my girlfriend's Alfredo (which was only a couple of forkfuls, as that Alfredo sauce was one of the foulest things I've ever eaten), but I still was left hungry.\n\nThe dessert course offered a distinctly rotten cherry on top of this already heaping garbage sundae. We were initially assured that all of the desserts were made in-house, but that soon proved not to be the case. Indeed, for several of our desserts, a store-bought version would have been an improvement. I ordered a cannoli, figuring that even a crappy Italian restaurant can't screw up a cannoli, as it is a violation of Italian Law or something. Unfortunately, their \"fresh-made\" cannolis consisted of a pre-packaged cannoli shell, pre-packaged cannoli filling (which, by the way, was gritty, as though someone had dumped in white sugar but not mixed the cream thoroughly enough for the sugar to dissolve), and put the two together in the kitchen. Needless to say, my cannoli was awful. My girlfriend ordered the tiramisu, and what she received was about as far removed from tiramisu as one can get. There were almost no ladyfingers, and the ones that were in the dish were drowning in coffee. On top of that, the dessert was swamped with an excessive amount of coffee-flavored cream that essentially destroyed the dish. My uncle's chocolate cake was dry and uninspiring; a store-bought cake would have been more moist.\n\nI did not pick up the check - my uncle was nice enough to do that - so I did not see the final bill. However, they could not have paid me to eat this often-inedible food. The service was slow and inattentive, the food was simply awful, and I left hungry. Do not waste your time, your money, or your energy with this place, as you can get better Italian food virtually anywhere else in the city.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5MChfa-jZfMo3vBpolkSbw"}

We always went for wing night, and the wings were very large and quite tasty. My favorite sauce was the honey jalapeno. While the wings were decent and cheap for the size, I had from day one thought the beers were a bit overpriced for the type of bar and location.  The wings kept me coming back, and they were cheap, so I didn't mind paying a little bit more for a few beers. As time went on, the menu seemed to go through a few changes...a few less items, and higher prices, and severely decreased portion sizes. I understand that as with anything, prices are always going to go up, but at the same time, the quality should remain the same or get better! This was not the case here, after giving them a few tries, I gave up. On my last few visits the food was absolutely awful, the portions were minuscule, and overall overpriced. They also did away with the 50 cent wing night. It always seemed that all the owner was concerned with was the almighty dollar. I tried the the corned beef sandwich just after St. Patty's day last year, and the corned beef was almost all fat, it was so bad that they took the sandwich and had me order a new item from the menu. After that I tried the fish and chips around lent, and what a joke it was! You got potato chips ( not home made), and a few tiny pieces of fish that were almost all breading. All of the \"specials\" that they have, whether they are food or drink, are not worth the prices that this place seems to think that they are. All of their \"special\" prices are what most other places have as their regular everyday prices!

Good food, not quite the value of Armstrong's but a closer drive.

Not a great start but we gave it a pass not knowing what she may have going on. We were seated and asked for our drink order. Drinks came fast but that was it. Once our orders we taken it was all down hill.\n\nThe kids' food came quickly as was decent. Once we received it, my son decided that he wanted a ginger ale. I told him to wait until the waitress came back and we would order one. She never did. \n\nOnce we started serving the kids, we realized that we didn't have napkins or silverware. We tried to catch the attention of another waitress but could not. The kids could eat their pizza and quesadilla with their hands but we needed napkins. My wife ended up going to the bathroom for paper towels. \n\nIt became comical after 15 or 20 minutes when my boys were done eating and our steak salad and steak hoagie did not come out. At that point, the table behind us caught another waitress walking by, \"We've been waiting for 15 minutes for our check.\" We weren't the only ones forgotten here. We couldn't even ask for our son's ginger ale or silverware for the table because nobody stopped by to check on us and our waitress was missing for over 20 minutes.\n\nWhen our food finally came out, we had been there for almost an hour. The kids were done eating so I asked if she could wrap it up. \"I'll bring you some boxes.\" Seriously? I could almost understand that response if we were troublesome. We didn't have the opportunity. In the hour that we had been there, the only contact with the staff was being seated, ordering, and receiving drinks and half of our food. The few touches we did have were decidedly negative.\n\nAs I sat there packing up my own food while my family got their coats on, I decided to write this review. What an awful experience. \n\nThe food was just OK. The quesadilla had bacon in it. Fine I guess but just call it a chicken bacon ranch quesadilla and serve ranch dressing instead of sour cream. Otherwise, just make a decent quesadilla. The kids pizza was fine. The steak salad tasted fine at our kitchen table. The steak was the best part. The rest was mostly head lettuce with a few tomatoes and cucumbers with shredded cheese on top. (Go to Armstrong's if you want to have it done right.) My steak hoagie was actually two mini sandwiches. They soaked the bread in butter making a fat pill even bigger. I wouldn't recommend it. Bellisario's across the street does it way better. The fries were fine.\n\nThey were busy but the general atmosphere, lack of service, general lack of caring makes this place the worst restaurant experience that we have had in a long time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ptmsW2SSeFD2I6vspJs0lQ"}

I will never order from there again.  I was hungry for some pizza and found a Bellisario's menu in the back of my desk (I suppose from the girl who worked here before me) and decided to try them.  Got a pizza with pepperoni and a slice of cheesecake.  When the driver brought it, it looked like he sat on the pizza box. He opened the box up and said to me that the box got bent and the cheese and pepperoni was all stuck to the top of the box.  He asked me if it was ok and he said it was only one piece that was ruined.  When it was really 3 slices that the toppings were stuck to the top of the box.  What was I gonna say, I was hungry, so I took it.  The pizza was awful, greasy and just ehhhh i can't even explain it.  \n\nSo I had a slice of pizza and was done with that and moved on to the cheesecake, which looked like it was about a month old and tasted pretty bad as well.  Only had a bite of that and threw it away.  I will never order from there again!", "type": "review", "business_id": "UjJMQguryo1jypomvOCZgg"}

When I asked again he said 14 inches so I ordered a medium cheese and an order of breadsticks.  \n\nI will confess that I didn't actually try the pizza because I had to send it back because it was well past the point of being edible.  It was like pizza soup in a crust bowl. \n\nThis place is using deck style brick ovens, which is about the only thing they are doing right.  They do not cook directly on the brick though, they use pizza screens.  The screens that they use are the ones with the really big holes as opposed to the grid style screens that everyone else uses.  I have never seen another shop use the big hole screens, and probably for a reason because the dough was really really terrible cooked.  It was burned to the point of being black on the bottom at (which I usually don't mind at all) but somehow they managed for it to still be completely doughy and soft and not the least bit crispy.  Honestly it seems like some kind of miracle of science to have a black pizza bottom and for it to not at least be a little bit crispy.  The pizza was definitely on the overly thick and doughy side and even if it had been cooked well it probably still would have been too doughy to be very good.  The dough recipe may or may not have tasted good, no one will probably ever know because it will probably never be cooked evenly enough to even have a chance at tasting good. \n\nThe biggest problem with the pizza overall was the 2 pounds of cheese sunken into a large gelatinous wad in the middle.  It smelled like decent cheese, probably Grande (although probably cut with something cheaper).  They are wasting so much money on cheese its sad.  Whoever the pizzaman was obviously took no pride in it whatsoever.  The sauce was all dropped into the middle with most of the cheese.  The edges of the pizza had big bubbles where all of the cheese and sauce should have been, but they were NOT the nice crispy kind of bubbles that could be enjoyed...just lumpy masses of sadness.  \n\nI can't comment on the taste of the sauce because I am not a brave enough man to have put a slice of this DIY toilet clogging kit into my delicate stomachular system.  Fake words aside, this pizza really sucks guys. \n\nThe icing on the cake were the breadsticks, a side item that I consider to be pretty un-f*ckable.  So for breadsticks, Mr. Bellesario (BTW, I hope that this is just some made-up Italian restaurant name and that someone doesn't actually put their family name behind this crap) just cuts up slices of the premade Sicilian dough and slaps some oil and herbs on it and calls it breadsticks.  Its the most ghetto attempt at this particular appetizer that I have ever heard of.  Its pretty funny, really. \n\n\nSo yeah, this place is definitely worth avoiding at all costs especially considering the prices aren't even good and the restaurant itself is completely filthy inside.  The owner was nice enough about refunding the money for the pizza.  Its a shame when I see businesses like this that are set in their ways and are really wasting their potential with a general lack of pride.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UjJMQguryo1jypomvOCZgg"}

I have a feeling that the manager was not in.\n\nAll five of the employees that I saw were under 18 (which, as a 21 year old, is not entirely an ageist comment). Even though there were only five customers in the store, it took nearly 20 minutes to prepare all five orders, after they were already taken. The cashier also had a lot of trouble counting money--her goal was to give me back $7.02 in change, but took the $5 out, said \"Oh shit,\" out loud, thought for a second, and then I reminded her that I need $2.02 more.\n\nAll five orders had exactly one item missing from their trays, and all of them were things that the cashier was responsible for. She forgot my chips for my taco salad, the cheese for two other customers, an incorrect drink for another. My drink wound up having zero carbonation.\n\nI finally made my way to the condiment counter, which had ketchup smeared all over it, including on the stack of ketchup cups. There were literally zero napkins, so I had to go ask for some from behind the counter.\n\nMany of the tables had a stray napkin or straw wrapper. While eating at one of them, one of the employees was in the dining room, yelling towards the counter (from about 20 feet away), \"Can you please tell Gary to fucking change these garbage cans?\" about five times. The cashier responded that she doesn't want to \"yell\" at Gary again.\n\nAs I cleaned my tray, I discovered the reason the garbage cans so desperately needed changed--I tried all three in the restaurant, but all of them were so full that I could barely open up the swing door on them, let alone put anything inside. I finally settled for putting my full tray on top of the entire garbage receptacle, for I had no other option.\n\nNone of this is exaggeration. I was seriously appalled.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dpRsK3JyaD3GKorVWzQUmA"}

There's really no use in rating the actual food, as it's hard to screw up food at a McDonald's. It's all subpar grub, but my penchant for getting filet-o-fish sandwiches this time of year lives on anyway, so I had to go satiate my once-a-year craving.\n\nMy issue was with the service. I walked in and the employees were just chatting it up with their friends and off-hours coworkers who were on the customer side of the counter. It was around 11pm and the lack of customers inside of the restaurant made it pretty obvious that I was the only person waiting for my order to be taken, but that didn't stop the employees behind the counter from finishing their conversations before taking my order.\n\nAfter I finally put my order in, I seemed to wait an eternity (in fast food terms) for my two filet-o-fish sandwiches, regular McBites, and medium french fry order. It was hardly a complicated order, but I've waited less time during peak hours at other fast food chains in the past. Thankfully, there was ONE girl working who saw me standing there for a long time, and asked, \"are his McBites up yet?...where are they?\" I was happy that someone had finally addressed the situation, but it shouldn't have taken that long.\n\nAgain, I'm aware that showing up at 11pm will probably increase my odds of walking into a late-night, preparing-for-the-next-day mess of a restaurant, but even in fast food, it's absurd to think that the level of cleanliness that I walked into is acceptable. Not to mention, the one girl who was working announcing that she was \"going to pee\"  while I was standing there. I wasn't offended at all, but I found it odd that she thought that was acceptable to say in front of a customer.\n\nI guess this experience reminded me of why I limit my trips to fast food chains as much as possible.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xUf11yTcoRagwNiJcY8GAA"}

I set up a account just for this review.  I was deeply sadden by the food I received today. \n\nI first started coming here since 1993. I have moved to Midwest four years later. However,  every times I drive thru Pittsburgh,I always stopped here. I really enjoy the general Tso' s chicken. As part of preparation, chicken was fried ahead of time,and fried again when you order, That is why their general Tso's Chicken was so crispy and aromatic when served. I did not have to make this stop, but after driving 450 miles, I wanted a decent meal.\n\nWell, I stopped by and order the Dish for carry out. When I open them(it was not long, 30 minutes or less), they were so soggy, and based on my experience who grew up on Chinese food, it was not fried the second time. The difference? They tasted worse than Buffet dish sitting above the steamer for hours. \n\nFurthermore, I have ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce. Shrimp was hard to chew. It seems like the shrimp the simmered in the sauce for ages. There was no aroma from garlic or onion. \n\nBeing a decent cook myself, I can tell you those dishes I ordered were not cooked by the main chef, or secondary chef. I suspect this is  probably made by the guy who station the fryer. Truly, the taste of those two dishes were so awful, I toss them out. I purchase those passing Pittsburgh, not really possible asking for refund.\n\nI have had so much memory with this place. Rest assured, I won't be coming ever. It was so bad, I would not dear to try again. \n\nI do hope the owner sees this, and make a statement of this incident. I eager to see you standby your dishes again. If I see owner's rebuttal, I would love to call the owner to discuss this encounter further, and willing to be convinced to come back.\n\nSincerely", "type": "review", "business_id": "hbFCv2Rginf9zjai-lKUNg"}

The restaraunt was half empty, and we sat there for 47 minutes with a little bread and oil--wich they refilled twice because the food was taking so long.  AND NEVER refilled our empty water glasses.  I decided at 50 minutes we were leaving.  Lo and behold at 47 minutes it comes out. Bland and soggy as we've ever tasted.  Opposite of what we expected from such an \"upscale\" Italian dining experience.    They never apologized for the long wait for our food and pretended everything was normal and fine.  We scarfed it down in a hurry to leave and asked for the bill. The waitress put it on the table and then took almost 10 minutes more to return to charge it when we were obviously packed up and ready to go.  We just walked up to the register and had someone else nearby handle it for us.  My husband went to pull the car around while I finished up with the bill.\n\n  Look, I know these are first world problems, and truthfully, my husband and I always enjoy each others company so much that we hardly notice a long wait for our food... PLUS... we were there on a gift card....     But we were trying to make it to a show that night and ended up arriving late and all for a meal that kinda sucked.\n\nEven worse, when my husband and I got up to leave, a table of 2 next to us received their food---- they had only been seated 15 minutes earlier!!!!\n\nI never complain about waitstaff mostly because I used to be a waitress, but what pushed me so far as to get on yelp about it is what I witnessed on the way out the door.  While I was standing by the door waiting for them to charge our card, A very elderly woman whom I had noticed was standing there a long time, asked the hostess...\"how much longer for a table?\"  and the hostess said...\"About 20 more minutes\".  The elderly woman replied..\"Thats what you said 20 minutes ago, and I see 5 empty tables.\"  The hostess got very rude with her and retorted \"Ma'am, some people plan ahead and make reservations, and its impossible to tell you the exact amount of time you will need to wait because we dont know how much longer people will be staying. They might order dessert, or more drinks. You can go to another establishment.\"\n\nSeeing this old woman as I would my own grandmother, I stuck my neck out and spoke up to the hostess.   I said...\"Listen, I've noticed this woman standing here a very long time.  You don't have any chairs for people up here to sit in and wait, so shes just been standing here. If you told her the wait was going to be 20 minutes, you need to seat her after 20 minutes.  If you were'nt sure exactly how long the wait would be, you should have told her that in the first place instead of getting angry at her for going by what YOU SAID.  Also, it would'nt hurt to show a little more respect to your elders.\"  \n\nThe hostess looked at her friend and rolled her eyes sarcasticly as to say...\"who is this bi***?\"  hahahaha.  VERY RUDE. VERY.   WORST SERVICE IN YEARS. SORRY.   Dishonorable staff.  Unimpressive food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA"}

I too once loved this restaurant, but we have had far too many terrible experiences to ever return.\n\nOur first bad experience was a year and a half ago.  My parents were visiting from out of town and my husband and I decided to take them here.  We were told the wait would be 30-45 minutes.  We were lucky enough to find two seats at the wine bar so we could share a bottle of vino and take turns sitting.  An hour went by... then an hour and fifteen minutes... We began to notice that some parties coming into the bar area after us were seated before us.  Then, we were finally told our table was ready and to follow them... only for one of the hostesses to stop the waitress who was seating us.  She told the waitress that the table was for someone else.  We then watched as they sat a party who had been waiting for less than 20 minutes.  I can only presume these people were friends with one of the hostesses.  At this point, over 90 minutes had passed and we were understandably upset.  I complained to the manager, a middle aged woman who showed absolutely no concern for the situation they had caused.  We should have left, but instead we ordered another bottle and waited another 20 minutes for our table in the extremely noisy front dining room.\n\nMy husband absolutely refused to go to this location after that incident, so our next incident was not until this past week.  We made reservations for a Friday night and I specifically requested a quiet table in the wine room if one was available.  I noted that we would be willing to switch our reservation to a half hour before or after if that gave us a better chance, knowing they can't completely control such things.  When we arrived, the hostesses appeared to be the same teenage or 20-something girls who worked here a year ago.  I don't know if they were or if this restaurant simply has a steady stream of insolent young girls from which to draw.  The girls looked at each other, continued to giggle and continue whatever conversations they had already been having, and eventually pulled out a couple menus for us.  They led us to a table for 8 which already had 4 people.  They then gestured towards the table and asked \"is this okay?\".  We responded that no, we had made a reservation and there were at least two open tables in the front dining room, so we expected to be sat there, outside or at the wine bar (we checked - there was a table open in the same room as the wine bar and one outside).  The girl then informed us that it would be another 20-30 minutes if we didn't want to sit at someone else's table.  I have never known Il Pizzaiolo to be communal seating so this was completely unacceptable.  We left and gave our business to another restaurant on the same street, where we had excellent food and excellent service.\n \nThis portion is regarding the other location downtown:\n\nOur third bad experience was the Market Square location this past Sunday.  We have had one less than favorable experience there before (they told my husband and I it would be a 2 hour wait for a table for 8, then told someone else from our party it would be 15 minutes only 10 minutes later... ), but we were willing to justify it and hoped it was an anomaly.  Sadly, they now seem to hire from the same pool as the Mt. Lebanon location.  We were told it would be a 20-25 minute wait for an outdoor table as 3 different 4 tops were finishing their dinner.  They said they would call us so we took a walk and returned 15 minutes later.  We waited at a public table in Market Square and WATCHED as the host and hostess cleared and then sat the 2 of the 4 tops.  When we went in to ask what was going on, we saw that all three 4 tops were actually resat.  We reminded them we were waiting and asked them when they would have our table ready.  We were told it would be another 20 minutes.  Goodbye!  Ciao, Il Pizzaiolo!  Never again.  We were able to be seated at Sienna immediately.  \n\nOwnership should be ashamed.  I don't know whether it is nepotism in the host positions or a complete lack of respect for their clientele.  I should add that on every occasion, a remark was made to at least a hostess, if not management, and no one offered even a sincere apology.  It is sad that people are willing to put up with this level of service.  There are plenty of other fine establishments in Pittsburgh, particularly Italian ones.  I have a whole list of Italian restaurants that have as good or better food, that would never treat their patrons like this.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA"}

I used to frequent this location years ago, and loved it!  I returned a few months ago, to get treated to an overpriced, underwhelming experience that led to both myself and my date getting food poisoning over bad mussels.  By the way, it was a first date, nothing says \"go out with this guy again\"  like being glued to your toilet the entire next day praying that you'll just die.\n\nI called them, and told them what happened (specifically stating I wasn't looking for a handout, I just wanted to let them know that their mussels had turned, and they should check their product), and the manager told me that I had to have been mistaken, and that they only keep in fresh ingredients.  They did send me a $15 gift card, which I thought was nice even though that a $15 gift card is the middle finger of gift cards, so I decided to try them once more.\n\nOK, so that was just a fluke, they gave me a gift card, time to put on my optimistic pants and try again.  So I took one of my long time friends out for lunch.\n\nWe walked in, and we were given the new option to sit in the \"Wine Bar\".  \n\nOOOooo, color me intrigued.  \n\nSo they took us outside, up some stairs, and into what I'm guessing was a middle aged Persian's studio apartment above a garage that they converted into a dining room.  We then waited for service for an inhuman amount of time before we were given waters.  I ordered a dry red wine, and my friend ordered a cocktail.  We waited, and eventually got those, and they were actually very nice.  \n\nWe ordered mussels again (cringe) and the meat and cheese plate.  First thing I knew was iffy was the meat and cheese plate.  They replaced the normal wooden board, and replaced it with a plate.  A white, boring, incredibly small plate.  On top of it all, it was more of a plate of lunch meat than a charcuterie!  Blah.  The mussels were good though, and my bowels remained intact, though we asked for bread when it was dropped, and had to ask for it a second time.  What a waste, the broth was actually good, but cold by the time we actually got our bread.\n\nSo I'm sorry Il Pizzaiolo, I really tried to like you, but until the quality returns, I won't be.\n\nTL;DR  Don't go here, there are a ton of cheaper, better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh", "type": "review", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA"}

Supposedly, they have an extensive Italian beer selection and a wood-fired oven, so off my hubby and I went. I looked over the menu and discovered they only had two (2) Italian beers (Moretti, Peroni). Disappointed but not giving up, we ordered one of each and proceeded. The waiter (Adam) comes over and tells about the specials before leaving again so we have time to make a choice. FYI - the wait staff tries to class up the place by acting as if they've lived in Italy and personally prepared the food so we played along. We ordered a few appetizers to try, salads, and I ordered a Pizza Margherita and my hub-a-bub ordered a Calzone. After we order, Adam brings us some squares of wood fired bread with EVOO. The bread was thick and doughy (clearly a filler). Then comes the appetizers along with the salads. We ordered Rice Balls (both cheese and cheese and meat), which had *no* flavor. We also ordered the the Potato Croquettes, which tasted *sour*. The salads looked fresh but was all green until you dug down to the bottom of the plate where there were two small pieces of red and orange pepper, a cherry tomato, and an olive. Said salad would have been really tasty, had the vinaigrette not been too sweet. Next came the entrees. The place is suppose to be known for their pizzas (that Adam said was a thin crust personalized pizza) but what I was served was a big blob of pizza dough with some cheese and sauce on top. My hub-a-bub's Calzone was a huge blob of thinly stuffed dough with some cheese and sauce on top. Clearly these folks haven't been to Italy or know what true Neapolitan Pizza looks like. Needless to say, I couldn't bring myself to touch or eat what amounted to a loaf of bread (aka an Il Pizzaiolo Pizza) but paid for it anyway. A $100 later, we would have been much happier, and better off to stay at home enjoying a good red wine, a fresh loaf of Italian bread, and a hunk of Parma cheese!    \n\nLater that evening, my iron stomach started to gurgle. Needless to say, I ended up riding the porcelain bus in one bathroom, with my hub-a-bub in the other, for the rest of the evening.\n\nAll I can say if you eat there, be ready for a bumpy ride.\nHappy eating!", "type": "review", "business_id": "6-rJjW6ITl5o_FliiNgZRA"}

He harassed my dinner partner and myself with a condescending tone regarding a sandwich that we order nearly every visit, which happened to be just last Sunday, in which we had great service (she must have worked at a steak house somewhere and SHOULD be the manager, her name is Erika, thank you Erika... and she was rewarded with a 30% tip.  Prior to the plate landing on the table, the waitress commented on its appearance. \n\nWe both agreed with her, tasted it as per our request to be nice, and sent it back to the kitchen as she recommended it prior to us tasting it.  It came back to the kitchen in the same condition, supposedly \"remade\"... which by that time, my sandwich was cold from waiting, in which I kindly requested it to be reheated if that was possible..  We have also ordered the same sandwich from about a dozen other Pittsburgh restaurants.. we know what it's supposed to look like and taste.\n\nNot to mention, our order was delivered wrong.  My offered sandwich toppings were not on the sandwich.  And my dinner's partner side was completely wrong.\n\nSo I complimented the waitress, I told her that she was great.  She told us that she did not know what was going on in the kitchen and that she was sorry for the third or fourth time... something that the \"Manager\" could learn to use in his vocabulary.\n\nSo after the second sandwich landed on our table, and we decided not to eat it.  My partner and I agreed to simply leave and eat elsewhere.  We were planning to pay for our drinks, and tip the waitress, and simply leave as we did not receive the food that we ordered... \n\nThen the \"Manager\" came out.. a loose cannon that has no business even working in an establishment.  He harassed us, we showed him the sandwich, a smooshed example of their culinary art that \"his guys worked so hard on\".  He did not understand the concept behind keeping customers, \"you can get it right 6/7 times a week, but tonight you got it wrong, and we are not paying for an ill-made sandwich\".  Those were my words.\n\nWe even politely called over the waitress to mediate his attitude that had no firsthand experience in our situation.. as she was readily available for us.  She flipped her story, so the sandwich and kitchen that was off in her opinion was suddenly on their A game tonight.  I guess the three to four prior apologies from her was also none of the \"Manager\"'s concern.   \n\nHe threatened to call the police and told us that he never wanted to see us again.  This was after he personally insulted myself for having a couple of light beers...as I was \"welcomed back to enjoy drinks since I enjoyed them so much.\" I told him that a personal insult was unnecessary and with that, I also advised him to attend a management school and that we will not pay for our meal.  He then harassed us more, asking us what was wrong with my sandwich.. at that point I was done.  I simply told him that we were not paying because of the way he treated us.\n\nThe staff illustrates the faces behind the business.  The Saloon would be great in the right hands, but it's in the wrong hands, run by people that may have over 30 years of ownership, but zero concern for their customers nor any competence in organizing and managing their business.  And that lends itself to a less than mediocre ambiance, low food quality, and inconsistent service... hence the 3 - 3.5 star rating seen around the Internet.  And the 5 stars... they had Erika and no \"Manager\" presence nor drinks from the bar.  Not to mention, the bartender has little competence in mixing drinks, hence the long beer list.  Save some money, fire the manager and the bartender.\n\nAfter walking half a block home, we changed our clothes from our traumatizing, filth of an experience from our lovely, family friendly neighborhood restaurant, and headed to the Walnut Grill, where we sent back the sandwich only once (thanks to a kitchen error on the order), there were only smiles and no threats.  There's a reason why Walnut Grill has several locations, the ambiance is killer, the service is stellar, the drinks are mixed the correct way, and the food is just as edible the next day, because it's that great to take home.  \n\nIF the owners were savvy and recognized that they live in 2015, they would know that this review alone can hurt their business by up to 20% or more.  I hope it does.\n\nA $8.99 Sandwich and incompetent service.. lost a tab + tip which was going to be paid.. weekly patrons.. and has initiated an interview with our dedicated lawyer.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jJfTh2O3M2Q716akd9Dr9w"}

But actually, in retrospect, its just a sign that people are not aware of the quality of sushi that can be found elsewhere in Pittsburgh. It was sad, really.\nWe began with the miso soup, which was some of the\nbest we have had. Nice and hot, and perfectly seasoned. But it was downhill from there.\nThe salad was just ok. Mixed greens were wilted, but the dressing was tasty.\nWe then moved on to the \"good stuff,\" or so we thought...\nWe began with the highly-recommended \"yellowtail sashimi with yuzu jalape\u00f1o sauce\" -- it was overly ceviche'd, and lost its freshness, replaced by a tough, dried-out quality. While a small sliver of jalapeno was a nice touch for sharpness, it didn't compensate for the poor quality preparation of the fish itself. We next had a spicy tuna roll (which, I think, is a barometer for sushi quality in any restaurant). It was dry and average, at best. Nothing special, but no egregious mistakes either. We moved on to the \"sushi entree (assorted)\", which had 8 pieces of assorted sushi, each consisting of a piece of fish: yellowtail prepared exactly like the previous dish but with rice this time; two pieces of salmon topped with (of all things) cream cheese and a cherry tomato (come on, this was so disappointingly reminiscent of brunch -- where's the caper and english muffin?; mackarel which was less-than-tasty, again topped with a dollup of something indistinct and non-complementary; tuna (average); red snapper maybe; and a paper-thin piece of mild whitefish, which tasted like rice, owing to its diminutive portioning; and a tuna maki roll, which was dry and shriveled and appeared limp, like it was prepared earlier that day.\nI was expecting an artful presentation, but was shocked at the lack of playful creativity that I, at that point, assumed might account for the inflated prices compared to other restaurants in the area (since the quality of flavor was actually MUCH poorer than other local places).\nNext to us was seated a couple on a date, where the man was clearly trying to impress his lady (both dressed very nicely and timidly fascinated by each other's every word and expression). I felt sorry for him, because he was either going to be disappointed with the meal itself, or oblivious to the fresh japanese seafood delights he could be exposing her to just a short drive away. THIS IS NOT A PLACE TO TAKE YOUR LOVE INTEREST, unless she is impressed simply by the magnitude of a check and a mere patina of fine dining.\nOur waitress was sweet, patient, and knowledgeable, and I couldn't help but wonder if she would recommend Umi to her family. I doubt it.\nWe concluded with a dessert that was simply delicious, playful and contemporary -- and weren't surprised to find that the desserts are actually part of the menu of their \"sister-restaurant,\" Soba (which is a WONDERFUL place). It was the Soba Banana Split - an unusual and tantalizing update of the original (which, I believe, was originally invented in Pittsburgh).\nOverall, the portions were small and unsatisfying, which would've been ok if the flavors were outstanding, but they were not. Not at all! I was shocked, and realized that a restaurant that should be credited with exposing the local eaters to fine Japanese cuisine years ago, has fallen from its lofty perch atop Pittsburgh's international dining choices. And fallen far.\nSo insular a chef can become when his cuisine is lauded for so long, that he can become ignorant of the ever-rising quality of his competition. I suggest Umi's chefs explore other restaurants and realize that they no longer have a monopoly on daily freshness, and that their creativity, like their salad, has become stale.\nTo people seeking high-quality sushi in the area, I must strongly recommend Ichiban (in Aspinwall), and before you question my credibility in recommending a restaurant nestled in a strip mall, think about what makes sushi wonderful. If unwavering freshness, playful inventiveness and sense of fun mixed with elegant presentation and even nice wine pairings, exactness in execution and preparation, thoughtful proportions as well as portions are qualities that not only enhance experience but even define Japanese cuisine, then Ichiban gets it right. Umi, I'm afraid, is way past its prime.\nIt's not that Umi is so bad. It's just not that good. Nothing special.\nI can say I have tried several other places in Pittsburgh, trying to find a suitable place to satisfy my frequent cravings for fresh raw seafood with a characteristically Japanese seriousness in its execution and levity of presentation and flavor combinations. Ichiban is the place that is consistently able to capture this \"essence\" of Japanese cuisine. But there are others that are also better than Umi, which should no longer, by any means, be considered a standard.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Cy9XgM3ZG2jZ1ganvolb6Q"}

She said they would check.  She returned not long after and said she was alright.  I relaxed a little, until another 15 minutes went by... it was now about 30 minutes since we had ordered and no food.\n\nWe waited a bit longer, we still hadn't seen Amanda (our waitress for those paying attention).

Zero stars for price. One star for food. \nI have been to the Harris Grill three separate times for dining.  The first was happy hour - with a party of six. We waited 30 minutes for a table; we watched several tables empty out and stay un-bussed and dirty for more than 10minutes at a time.  Obviously they must have been understaffed.  Once seated, service was extremely slow.  Our server was slow to arrive at our table to begin and take our drink order. Our drinks took even longer to arrive (approx. 20 min from when seated.)  The appetizers were tasty, although overpriced. Buffalo chicken dip was very good. Service remained poor.  Perhaps they were just very busy and understaffed. \n\nThe second time I came was midweek, midday, for lunch.  The place was mostly empty.  Surely we would get good, prompt service now?  Not so much.  All I ordered was the chocolate cupcake dessert.   It took about 25 minutes.  It looked like half a cupcake was dropped on the floor, and then attempts made at making the broken pieces look presentable on a plate.  Half of it was luke-warm, half of it was cold.  Terrible.  WTF?\n\nThe most recent and I promise the last time I will ever go to the Harris Grill was a Sunday for brunch.  Again a 30min wait for a party of 3 to be seated.  I understand that - its Sunday - its Brunch - lots of places have a wait.  But again we watched table after table go empty and stay dirty.  Finally seated it again took 20 minutes to get our drinks - orange juice. And then the waitress only brought two of the three beverages.  The third took another 10 minutes.  Seriously??  Our food took an hour. SERIOUSLY OVERPRICED!!  Several items on the menu were out.  (We arrived at noon for a brunch that was supposed to last from 10-2pm).  The menu was prix fixed at $14.  $14 for two pieces of French toast with disgusted, dried out frozen tater tots. (They had run out of home fries). The eggs Benedict were dried and hardened - just plain gross.  The eggs over easy had no runny yolk. The sausage was very good.  They served us the wrong toast.

So I was in need of a lunch and off to the garden. I decided a nice salad would do the trick so I ordered the Salad de la Burgh.

After these little gems I started to scope out the place, kind of soak in the atmosphere. \"Filth\" the joint is run down and fifthly, make matters worse was the cement block propping open the door to the patio outside ( this is the front door to the restaurant people ). \nThe restaurant was busy and my server was a pleasant enough young woman. I received my beverage and then started to check the staff out and how unkempt most of them where, jeans extremely tight and unflattering on the best figures, Harris Grill shirts were not much better trust. I long for the day when restaurants hired servers because they had mad skills not because they are young or hip. My favorite is when I realize that under the host station there were bus pans ( dirty & full ), one young employ thought nothing of maneuvering it with her foot ( disgusting it is on the floor but also the unsanitary way it was handle )\nLet me now explain the salad I got for eleven dollars and some cents. The lettuce was about a cup spring mix I think, not crisp and wilty, and kind of room temperature. The chicken was cold, so was the few fries they put on it, and a half a hardboiled egg. I think I found a few pieces of onion? Two grape size tomatoes, and two thin slices of cucumber. \"Oh\" there was a sprinkling of mozzarella or provolone cheese on it, could not tell which ( they say both so I will go for that ). This was placed in an average soup bowl. To say I will ever go back to the Harris Grill is a definite not & I will warn others to avoid. \n\"PS\" I did not expect the salad to be huge or grand but decent and somewhat hearty, this was subpar, could have gotten a better one at Wendy's and it would have been warm meat, and fries ...", "type": "review", "business_id": "rgmptwPbBH1wLpiBHcbIhA"}

To top it all off, when we tried to get his attention so we could get our checks he turned to us and said \"I'm busy,man\" and again walked away.  \n\nAlthough it was quite clear that the restaurant was busy and our group was as understanding as possible, the combination of the wait time and the absurd unprofessional behavior of our waiter ruined our night.

My omelette, however, was inedible -- a round, rock-hard disk smothered in cheese.  In a addition, we ordered a fruit plate for $7 which was a complete embarassment of several tiny pieces of fruit strewn about a plate with a tiny souffle cup of yogurt.  I hardly ever send food back or complain but this was really bad.

The older gentleman was screaming that she was always interfering with the list and he was done with it.

What was wrong with my service?\" My friends had left this woman at least a 15% tip. I will never forget this publicly humiliating moment for the rest of my life. This should serve as a reminder and a stark warning for all who work in customer service (as I have myself) that you should never, ever do something as atrocious as what this waitress did.

We went somewhere else to get a drink because it was going to be a 45-minute wait. The restaurant never called us, so we ended up eating elsewhere. \n\nTrying not to let the first experience color our opinion of the restaurant we went back a second time with open minds. This time we literally got sat at a table in the kitchen hallway. The drink prep table was so close behind me that I couldn't even sit comfortably. (I wish I had reached around and heavily helped myself to the liquor the way the meal went...) The main portion of the restaurant has ambient lighting and a romantic feel. However, our table was cast in the bright glare of the kitchen pass-through window that was basically at the end of our table. The service staff couldn't fit past our table in order to pick up the food. They kept tripping over one another repeatedly and often were yelling so loudly to one another that we couldn't even have a conversation across the table. We then witnessed a fight between the chef and the owner at which point I literally burst out laughing at the absurdity that we were actually seated there. The owner saw me laughing and made some joke about having the best seat in the restaurant and getting to hear the kitchens' comments. Obviously the \"best seat\" part of his comment was sarcastic, but I don't think he has ever sat at our table to realize how horrible it truly is. He thought I was laughing about the chef's comments... absolutely clueless.  \n\nI will absolutely never return and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

I say, \"might be\" because on my recent (and last) trip there I didn't have an opportunity to sample them.  In fact, I didn't eat anything at all.\n\nPlease let me explain.\n\nThe restaurant is located in the basement of a building off of Walnut Street.  Customers are expected to wait in a line that stretches from the entrance, through the main dining area, to a counter where the crepes are ordered and cooked.  It's a horrendous setup for multiple reasons.  \n\nFirst, there aren't many tables.  When I went there on a Saturday morning, there were at least 20 people standing in line for the ten or so small tables.  Second, the restaurant expects you to wait in line, standing next to tables of patrons who are eating their food, until a table becomes free.  At that point, the woman at the counter takes the next order, a man begins preparing the crepes, and the front of the line is seated while everyone else continues to wait.  Those who have waited long enough, are finally able to sit, while hungry and impatient diners-to-be stand next to their table and wait some more.\n\nIt's a horrible atmosphere, and not one conducive to a pleasant dining experience.\n\nThe dining space is poorly designed, so that the line of waiting patrons snakes directly though the middle of the cramped dining area.  Which means that when you are waiting, you are continually bumped by servers shuttling food to the tables and dirty dishes back to the kitchen.  When you are eating, you are likely to: 1) have a bunch of hungry people staring at you eat, waiting for you to leave your table, so that they may be seated; and/or 2) have a standing person's ass within a few inches of your head.  What a great dining atmosphere!\n\nWhat's all the more annoying is the lackadaisical work ethic of the people who prepare the crepes.  More than once during my wait, the man making the crepes just stood around, not making any food, waiting for another table to open, so a party's order could be taken, and he could then prepare the next order.  \n\nAfter waiting 15-20 minutes while hungry, becoming increasingly annoyed at being bumped at least 2 dozen times by serves traversing the line, and then seeing the owner stop making food until another order was taken, I said to myself, \"enough of this nonsense\".\n\nMy party and I left to go to another restaurant.  I've not eaten any crepe in the world that would justify a long wait under such annoying circumstances, and I will not be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cmGR1HS9ms233roSllcglw"}

They no longer do easter brunch, but they do have their martini bar - which many people seem to rave about. I should have stopped to think twice upon seeing that all 5 reviews here on yelp are at least 2 years old, but I threw caution to the wind and arrived early on a Friday evening.\n\nJust getting off work, I came alone. The location is a historical landmark, a mansion built in 1889, and is the reason they deserve their single star. The mansion, from the lobby in the bar appears beautifully kept. The walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass. The furniture is elegant but not stuffy, and the bar was obviously once a den or a library that was converted. The bar is rather small, housing four 2-seat tables, a 4-top, and about 8 spaces at the bar. Behind the bar, light shines through a small collection of liquor bottles. The top of the bar and tables are inlaid with tile patterns and candles are spread throughout.\n\nI browsed the martini menu, not finding much that would suit my palate as it all sounded sweeter, or too far from a martini(tequila, cointreau, and orange juice is closer to a margarita than a martini - and that Jose Cuervo on your top shelf doesn't send a good impression of your margarita). I stuck with the classic, then, and ordered a basic dry gin martini without garnish. \n\nIt was made quickly and without love, shaking instead of stirring, and putting it in an un-chilled glass. Not that there was much to love, while the bottles on the shelf could be called mid-range, the bottles used for my drink and for others were right out of the bottom of the barrel. Banker's Club is the gin of choice here, and Burnett's flavored vodka is the base of most of the drinks on their menu. The martini came(Not filled to the top, seems they measure precisely to include garnish), strong with little vermouth, but given the alcohol, devoid of any flavor but ethanol and a hint of citrus.\n\nI found as I drank that food is no longer available at all in the hotel as they no longer served as a restaurant, even though signage was still in place throughout the building. I quietly finished my drink and closed my tab. How much did my room temperature Banker's Club cost? A cool $9.\n\nIt appears that somewhere between the last two years and now, this hotel must have come upon hard times or new management. If you are staying at the hotel and need a drink, hop a cab to Walnut street. At least your hassle will be eased by a much better drink.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rm1hBa1HPcLhUSwuincX2Q"}

The service was poor. Our waitress was a nice gal who was working hard, she simply had too many tables because the place was woefully understaffed. Our drinks weren't refilled in a timely manner and she was usually too busy to check on us. I had to go and find her a few times to get things that were missed. \n\nI don't mind paying the high prices of the old place if the food is good. Unfortunately the food was a let down. Four of us ordered the French onion soup. The soup was so salty it was rendered uneatable. The steak was good, but the baked potato was so dry I thought it left over from lunch. My daughter ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and it was quite bland. Everything else we ordered was just ok. To sum it up, our meal was mediocre at best and we were all disappointed. Not one person on our party of seven really enjoyed their meal. \n\nI express my dissatisfaction with our waitress and she informed me that she would write my complaints in a book they kept. That was it. I left with the feeling that they were happy that they got my money and that they did not really care that my family's dinner was poor. They made no effort to make it right and they made no effect to ease my displeasure. \n\nThis will be my last family dinner at the old place. I will take my business to a place that has better food and a place that values it's customers.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WrP8KeKTlWcjqQPj2DJKGQ"}

I'm begging you. I wouldn't wish this place on my own worst enemy. I wouldn't wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend. This place was a literal nightmare. .\n\nI think I've been to Jimmy Wan's 4 times this month, so I was sick of it. Plus I'd heard good things about TaiPei, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.\n\nThe service was abysmal - my waiter took 10 minutes to recognize I'd sat down. He was very kind, but only dropped my food off. No \"how's it going\", no water refills, no offer of dessert or other courses. A kind busboy kept refilling my drink. \n\nThe portions are extremely small - I've never seen such tiny sushi rolls in my life. The menu says there's a charge for fried rice instead of white. Huh. Jimmy Wan's offers white and brown, no extra charge. Interesting.\n\nThe atmosphere was atrocious.  A family in the table to my left and in front let their child (6 or 7, mind you) take off his shoes and walk around. He then ground his heel into the carpet - with a piece of chicken in between. He swiped a cloth napkin from an empty table and rubbed it all over his feet. I audibly gasped, but his obese mother couldn't hear me or ignored me. Then she threatened to take each of their Kindles away if they didn't shut up. The boy was eating with salad tongs instead of a fork all night long.\n\nThe waitstaff saw what was happening and didn't care at all. My waiter didn't show up after I was finished with my meal and when he did (after I'd requested someone else get him) he failed to clear my dirty plates. I finally told the owner how terrible the whole thing was - namely the ambiance and the service and she asked if I wanted anything to go and apologized for being busy. You...think I want something to go? How were 15 people in the 50 seat restaurant and one small takeout order. How....is that busy?\n\nOther reviews have mentioned that the ownership has changed hands. If you care about your health, don't go to a restaurant where the waitstaff doesn't care if children grind chicken into the carpet. If they find that behavior outside of the kitchen normal, can you imagine what they do inside the kitchen? I have no doubt little handwashing goes on and much wiping of noses while cooking.\n\nJews, don't go here on Christmas, even if though they loudly advertise they're open. If 15 people means they're \"busy\", can you imagine what it'll be like on Christmas?\n\nThe slowness of the whole establishment is astounding. I dropped my little brother off at Jimmy Wan's immediately before going to TaiPei - a 15 second drive between establishments. Wan's parking lot was jam packed and he ate with 9 other friends. He called me to pick him up as I was paying the bill. How the hell did TaiPei take as long as Jimmy Wan's did to seat and serve and bill 10 people as they did me, the 15th person in their restaurant?\n\nOnly go here if you have a death wish or are a practicing masochist.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dwz55gqPZwSBD74yFFb27g"}

I will definitely be sending a letter to the corporate office on this place. Upon entering for my families 1st time trying this spot for take out it would be our last.  I was in total shock seeing the cashier handling the register then placing lids on the tartar sauces used for the meals.  At no point was any washing of the hands or using gloves ever attempted, mind you dealing with the register.  As my families meal was brought out, I see a line cook stuffing his face with no gloves on just his bare hands.   I said to myself, this is unsanitary practices being used here.  I then ask another worker to call the managers attention who's behind her and she gets into the \"deer\" mode, acting as if who's the manager. I finally make eye contact with him as he knew I was right and went to the kitchen to possibly tell the guy stuffing his face, you got caught.  The manager was looking all dirty himself too, no name tag, no indication that he's the manager.  I asked for a full refund, I was not spending my money here.  I then ask for his name which he pulls out his a$$ and says it's \"Mr. Rapport\".  Well that's the name I'll use when I compile a letter to the corporate office.

Not only that, but she completely ignored me as if I wasn't sitting right there. \n\nTo make matters worse...much worse, our yummy carbonara had a hair in it. A nice long blonde hair. I was done. I pulled it out and showed my date, he looked at it and told me to just get rid of it. Ok, I did, and I stopped eating. He kept eating lol, until...I found another hair!!!!!!!! Yuck!!!! There is nothing worse than someone else's hair in your food. The night was ruined for me, and we both stopped eating, I never speak up when I am unhappy about something. I am just naturally a friendly, non-confrontational girl, but I felt like I had to say something! No one should have to eat food with hair in it, and have to pay $19 for it. \n\nAlas, my date didn't want to make things more awkward since  out server seemed to be on the verge of an emotional breakdown. So, I kept quiet against my better judgement. She later returned with the check, which was wrong, and claimed that she would have to pay the difference out of her pocket if she tried to change it. Confused! Then she asked us to do the survey and give her 5 stars. Ha! I just started laughing, I was sure this entire night was a joke. \n\nShe literally said, as she knelt down to our table and clasped her hands as if in prayer (I couldn't make this up guys) I'm new here, could you please give me 5 stars, for the good of humanity, and for all those people without jobs in the world.) This was entertaining. Then, she proceeded to take my dates credit card and flirt with him some more! She touched his chest and asked if he had any brothers. Holy...cannoli... get me out of here!

My wife and I went on a Thursday night. The place was less than half full, yet the hostess had us wait between 5-10 minutes for them to clean a table before seating us. Seems kind of asinine when there are plenty of empty seats throughout the restaurant. I understand that due to staffing they may have wanted to sit us in a particular server's section, but I believe customer service is all about perception. Our waitress did not seem very enthusiastic.\n\nThe food was a mixed bag. My wife enjoyed her LongHorn Salmon, but my Renegade Top Sirloin was ruined by being served completely drenched in oil. I've eaten at Longhorn in Maine a couple of times, and don't remember their steaks being served this way. If this is normal here, then I much prefer the steaks at Texas Roadhouse for this price range. My lobster tail was good, and not overcooked. For dessert, my wife and I shared a Caramel Apple Goldrush. This was most excellent, and almost warranted an extra star.\n\nThe main reason for the one star is what happened after our visit. I had left a $10 cash tip, and filled out the credit card slip to reflect this. A few days later, when the charge showed up on my credit card statement, I found that an additional $10 had been added. I immediately went back to the restaurant and spoke very cordially with a manager, showing him the receipt for my visit and my credit card statement. Everyone makes mistakes, but it's how a business handles a customer after a mistake is made that sets the tone for future business. The first thing he did, after researching the error in the back, is offer a $10 coupon. That is not acceptable to me, because to take advantage of this, I'd have to eat here again. He asked me what he should do (isn't HE the manager?), and I suggested that he credit the overcharge back to my card, or void/refund the full amount, and recharge it. I was told that I'd have to fill out a form that would have to be faxed to corporate, then I'd have to wait an unknown number of days to see the amount credited back to my card. I understand that there may be corporate policies that he has to follow, but there seemed to be very little compassion or empathy on his part. He should have still offered the coupon or maybe a comp'd entr\u00e9e for the trouble of driving all the way back to the store because of a pretty significant error one of their employees made. No such luck. I would not have necessarily accepted the offer, but the gesture would definitely be appreciated and goes a long way towards a customers' perceptions about how important they are to a business. I do have a background in customer service management, and this would have never flown under my watch.\n\nMy wife and I have never been disappointed at Texas Roadhouse in Matthews, where the staff has always been enthusiastic and the food is exactly what we expect at this style of restaurant. I guess we'll stick with that when we're in the mood for a slab of beef and all the fixin's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AUDuCSWYzzRP3H2w7TxtuQ"}

I wanted something to go so the hostess (very politely) sent me to the bar. The guy took my order and promptly brought me my beer and check and never spoke to me again. 20ish minutes later I saw someone bring a bag out and set it on the bar. I figured it was someone else's food since the bartender (who was engrossed in conversation) didn't bring it to me. After several minutes the bartender broke from his conversation and brought me the awaiting bag. All in all it was about 30 minutes from ordering to giving the food to me (in a mostly empty restaurant). When I got the steak home and cut into it, it was mostly brown with a hint of red in the very middle. I ordered it medium rare which the menu said would be mostly red with a hint of pink. \n\nI guess the moral of the story is to not order food at the bar and/or cut into your steak before you take it away because it may be WAY over done. And honestly if you're gonna order $20 something dollars worth of steak, what's the point in cooking out all the deliciousness?!", "type": "review", "business_id": "AUDuCSWYzzRP3H2w7TxtuQ"}

Chrystal was rude and inattentive. We sat for many minutes before she walked by and said (with a grown) \"I'll be with ya'll eventually.\" After another 2-3 minutes she finally came to the table, by this time we had already decided what we were going to eat, so we gave her the whole order. She said she would put the order in and bring our drinks right back. She left for a few more minutes, came back and checked in with another table without our drinks. She then went to get our drinks. She checked in with us multiple times throughout our meal just in passing, and not acknowledging when we needed more drinks and forcing us to either put empty glasses to the end of the table or request them. About halfway through eating, she brought us the check, never inquiring if we would want dessert. When she came back 5-10 minutes later, we had long since finished eating and asked for 2 boxes. She brought the boxes and my 6 year old had decided to take her leftovers home as well, so we asked for a third, only for her to promptly roll her eyes at the table and walk away without acknowledging our request verbally. When she came back, a member of my party outstretched her hand to take the box and begin packaging the leftovers, when Chrystal looked right at her and put the box on the end of the table, just out of her reach. After the check was paid and we stood up to leave, I witnessed Chrystal do a celebratory dance that we were leaving. Very visible and inappropriate. I understand that her shift was probably over, but I am disgusted that this is the way that servers are allowed to act in this establishment and will NOT be returning.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DE_11y6_vCmPBlbeYskh-Q"}

When we walked in I told my party to 'Let's leave because there were a total of 2 patrons,' but they insisted that we stay.  So we did and thus began the nightmare of hellish food.  The only bright spot was the waitress.  Service was good and we had some idiots in our party.  Plus it was seven of us.  She did good.\n\nTo the food.  I ordered from their 'new' menu the steak & quinoa.  The steak was old and dry and instead of pink in the middle for medium rare it was gray.  And it had a smell to it.  The runny quinoa was a mess and hard to boot.  It smelled & looked like food that was out of a bag & dumped into the plate for the microwave.  My granddaughters chicken tenders were as hard as rocks and her fries were cold.\n\nMy daughter's ribs were slathered in sauce but underneath were hard and old.  The broccoli was underdone and was that pale green they are underneath before cooking. The salad was drowned in Ranch dressing and the iceberg lettuce was old as shoe leather in a thrift shop.\n\nThe drinks seemed ok as my daughter ordered four shots.  But I don't even recommend going to the bar.  The bartender stood there and picked her nose.  Then flicked.  Again, the bartender picked her nosed and. Then.

The Zuppa Toscana was devoid of the spiciness that makes the soup as well as full of fatty sausage.\n\nI also ordered the Ravioli di Portobello, it came out stone cold, unacceptable for a baked entree.

Finally waited forever to ask for a to-go box and our check, only to hear him whine to another person right behind us about how he can't seem to catch a break and how he can't even pronounce my name. Ahem, ok, but don't say it right in front of the customer?? :)\n\nFood portions were great and entrees were yummy, but breaksticks were not warm as we've come to expect from Olive Gardens. And did I mention that we didn't get any extra? :D\n\nAnyways, horrible experience. Maybe he was having an off day, but I'd suggest asking to be waited by someone else (everyone else seemed wonderful!) and I believe your server's attitude is directly proportional to your dining experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4WsTFTH8GgnyFHwrH9nHzA"}
